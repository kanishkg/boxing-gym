Examples include (7.08, 1), (0.30, 1), (0.67, 1), and (9.36, 1).\n\n2. **Binary Value of 0**: When the binary value is 0, the response is more variable and seems to depend on the continuous value:\n   - **Low Continuous Values**: For low continuous values (e.g., around 0.5), the response tends to be 0. Examples include (0.51, 0) and (0.24, 0).\n   - **Moderate to High Continuous Values**: For moderate to high continuous values, the response can be either 0 or 1. Examples include (7.08, 0) resulting in 1, and (5.45, 0) resulting in 0.\n\nIn summary, if the binary value is 1, predict a response of 1.
