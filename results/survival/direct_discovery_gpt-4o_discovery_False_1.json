Here are the key patterns identified:\n\n1. **Integer Value of 1**: When the integer value is 1, the binary response is consistently 1, regardless of the floating-point number. This suggests that the integer value of 1 strongly dictates a binary response of 1.\n\n2. **Integer Value of 0**: When the integer value is 0, the binary response is more complex and seems to depend on the floating-point number:\n   - For low floating-point numbers (e.g., 0.00, 0.39), the response can be either 0 or 1, indicating some exceptions or specific thresholds.\n   - For floating-point numbers around 2.04, the response is 0.\n   - For floating-point numbers around 3.02, the response is 1.\n   - For floating-point numbers around 3.46, the response is 0.\n\nThis suggests a possible threshold effect where the binary response changes based on the floating-point number when the integer value is 0. The exact threshold is not fully clear but seems to be around 3.02. \n\nIn summary, the integer value of 1 almost always results in a binary response of 1, while the integer value of 0 results in a binary response that depends on the floating-point number, with some specific thresholds influencing the outcome."
