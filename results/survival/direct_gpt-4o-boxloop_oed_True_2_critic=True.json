            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset and the nature of the problem, we need to model the probability of a patient's outcome (whether they died or not) based on the time since surgery and metastasized status. This is a classic binary classification problem, which can be effectively modeled using logistic regression.\n\n#### Hypotheses:\n1. The probability of death (outcome) is influenced by the time since surgery and whether the cancer metastasized.\n2.
