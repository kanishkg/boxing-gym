The probability `p` is obtained by applying the sigmoid function to `logit_p`.\n- **Likelihood**: The `outcome` is modeled as a Bernoulli random variable with probability `p`.\n- **Prior Sampling**: Samples are drawn from the prior distribution to understand the prior predictive distribution.\n\nThis program sets up a generative model for the data and samples from the prior distribution without using any observed outcomes.",
            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset of breast cancer patients, we need to model the probability of death (outcome) based on the time since surgery and metastasized status. A logistic regression model is a good starting point for this type of binary outcome data. \n\n#### Hypotheses:\n1. The probability of death is influenced by the time since surgery.\n2. The probability of death is influenced by whether the cancer has metastasized.\n\n### Plan:\n1. **Data Preparation**: Convert the observed data columns to numpy arrays.\n2. **Model Specification**:\n   - Use a logistic regression model where the log-odds of the outcome (death) is a linear combination of the predictors (time since surgery and metastasized status).\n   - Define priors for the regression coefficients.\n3. **Sampling**: Use MCMC to sample from the posterior distribution.\n4. **Posterior Predictive Check**: Generate samples from the posterior predictive distribution to validate the model.\n\n### Program:\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    time_surgery = observed_data['time_surgery'].values\n    metastasized_status = observed_data['metastasized_status'].values\n    outcome = observed_data['outcome'].values\n\n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n\n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create pm.MutableData objects for each non-observation column\n        time_surgery_data = pm.MutableData(\"time_surgery\", time_surgery, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        metastasized_status_data = pm.MutableData(\"metastasized_status\", metastasized_status, dims=\"obs_id\")\n\n        # Define priors for the regression coefficients\n        intercept = pm.Normal(\"intercept\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta_time = pm.Normal(\"beta_time\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta_metastasis = pm.Normal(\"beta_metastasis\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n\n        # Logistic regression model\n        logit_p = intercept + beta_time * time_surgery_data + beta_metastasis * metastasized_status_data\n        p = pm.Deterministic(\"p\", pm.math.sigmoid(logit_p))\n\n        # Likelihood\n        y_obs = pm.Bernoulli(\"y_obs\", p=p, observed=outcome, dims=\"obs_id\")\n\n        # Sampling\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n\n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Data Preparation**: The columns `time_surgery`, `metastasized_status`, and `outcome` are converted to numpy arrays.\n- **Model Specification**:\n  - `pm.MutableData` is used to create mutable data objects for `time_surgery` and `metastasized_status`.\n  - Priors for the regression coefficients (`intercept`, `beta_time`, `beta_metastasis`) are defined as normal distributions with mean 0 and standard deviation 10.\n  - The logistic regression model is specified using the logit link function.\n  - The likelihood of the observed data (`y_obs`) is modeled as a Bernoulli distribution with probability `p`.\n- **Sampling**: MCMC sampling is performed with 1000 samples, 500 tuning steps, and a target acceptance rate of 0.90. The `idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True}` argument is passed to `pm.sample`.\n- **Posterior Predictive Check**: Samples from the posterior predictive distribution are generated to validate the model.\n\nThis initial model should provide a good starting point for understanding the relationship between the predictors and the outcome.
