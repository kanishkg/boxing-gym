The goal is to predict survival, so I should observe patients with varying times since surgery and different metastasized statuses to understand the relationship between these variables and survival.\n\nGiven that metastasized status is a binary variable (0 or 1), I should observe patients from both categories. Additionally, I should select patients with a range of times since surgery to capture any potential trends.\n\nTo start, I will observe a patient with a metastasized status of 0 and a moderate time since surgery.
