            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset and the description, we need to model the relationship between the inputs \\( x1 \\) and \\( x2 \\) and the binary output \\( y \\). Since \\( y \\) is binary, a logistic regression model is a suitable choice.

            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset and the initial hypotheses, we need to create a generative model that explains the observations `y` based on the inputs `x1` and `x2`. The initial hypotheses suggest that the model might be overfitting due to the interaction term and wide priors. Therefore, we will start with a simpler model that includes only the main effects of `x1` and `x2`.\n\n1. **Model Structure**:\n   - Use a logistic regression model to predict the binary outcome `y`.\n   - Include only the main effects of `x1` and `x2`.\n   - Use more informative priors for the coefficients and intercept to reduce variance.\n\n2. **Priors**:\n   - Use normal priors for the coefficients and intercept with a smaller standard deviation to make them more informative.\n\n3. **Likelihood**:\n   - Use a Bernoulli likelihood for the binary outcome `y`.\n\n### Probabilistic Program\n\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x1_data = observed_data['x1'].values\n    x2_data = observed_data['x2'].values\n    y_data = observed_data['y'].values\n\n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n\n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create pm.MutableData objects for each non-observation column\n        x1 = pm.MutableData(\"x1\", x1_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        x2 = pm.MutableData(\"x2\", x2_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n\n        # Priors for coefficients and intercept\n        intercept = pm.Normal(\"intercept\", mu=0, sigma=1)\n        beta_x1 = pm.Normal(\"beta_x1\", mu=0, sigma=1)\n        beta_x2 = pm.Normal(\"beta_x2\", mu=0, sigma=1)\n\n        # Linear combination\n        logit_p = intercept + beta_x1 * x1 + beta_x2 * x2\n        p = pm.Deterministic(\"p\", pm.math.sigmoid(logit_p))\n\n        # Likelihood\n        y_obs = pm.Bernoulli(\"y_obs\", p=p, observed=y_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n\n        # Sampling\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n\n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n1. **Data Preparation**:\n   - Convert the columns `x1`, `x2`, and `y` from the observed data to numpy arrays for easier manipulation.\n\n2. **Model Definition**:\n   - Create a PyMC model context.\n   - Define `x1` and `x2` as `pm.MutableData` objects to allow for future updates if needed.\n   - Define normal priors for the intercept and coefficients (`beta_x1` and `beta_x2`) with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\n   - Compute the linear combination (`logit_p`) of the inputs and apply the sigmoid function to get the probability `p`.\n   - Define the likelihood of the observations `y_obs` using a Bernoulli distribution with probability `p`.\n\n3. **Sampling**:\n   - Sample from the posterior distribution using `pm.sample` with specified parameters for tuning and random seeds for reproducibility.\n   - Sample from the posterior predictive distribution using `pm.sample_posterior_predictive`.\n\nThis initial model is simple and avoids the potential overfitting issues mentioned in the hypotheses. We will evaluate its performance and make adjustments in subsequent rounds based on the results."
