For example, tuples like (6.12, 1), (9.64, 1), and (4.85, 1) all resulted in a response of 1.\n\n2. **Integer Value 0**: When the integer value is 0, the binary response is more variable and seems to depend on the binary value:\n   - **Low Binary Values**: For very low binary values (e.g., around 0.02), the response tends to be 0, as seen in the tuple (0.02, 0).\n   - **Middle Binary Values**: For middle-range binary values (e.g., around 5), the response can be 1, as seen in the tuple (5.46, 0).\n   - **High Binary Values**: For high binary values (e.g., around 9), the response can be 0, as seen in the tuple (9.19, 0).\n\nIn summary, the integer value of 1 generally leads to a response of 1, while the integer value of 0 leads to a response that depends on the binary value, with low values tending towards 0 and middle to high values being more variable."
