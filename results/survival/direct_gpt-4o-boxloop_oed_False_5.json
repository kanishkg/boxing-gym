            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset and the description, we need to model the relationship between the input variables \\( x1 \\) and \\( x2 \\) and the observed output \\( y \\). Since \\( y \\) is binary (0 or 1), a logistic regression model is a suitable choice. This model will allow us to estimate the probability of \\( y \\) being 1 given the inputs \\( x1 \\) and \\( x2 \\).\n\n### Plan\n1. **Model Choice**: Use a logistic regression model to predict the probability of \\( y \\) being 1.\n2. **Priors**: Use weakly informative priors for the coefficients and intercept.\n3. **Likelihood**: Use a Bernoulli distribution for the observed data \\( y \\).\n\n### Program\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x1_data = observed_data['x1'].values\n    x2_data = observed_data['x2'].values\n    y_data = observed_data['y'].values\n\n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n\n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create pm.MutableData objects for each non-observation column\n        x1 = pm.MutableData(\"x1\", x1_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        x2 = pm.MutableData(\"x2\", x2_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n\n        # Priors for the coefficients and intercept\n        intercept = pm.Normal(\"intercept\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta_x1 = pm.Normal(\"beta_x1\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta_x2 = pm.Normal(\"beta_x2\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n\n        # Linear combination\n        logit_p = intercept + beta_x1 * x1 + beta_x2 * x2\n        p = pm.Deterministic(\"p\", pm.math.sigmoid(logit_p))\n\n        # Likelihood\n        y_obs = pm.Bernoulli(\"y_obs\", p=p, observed=y_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n\n        # Sampling\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n\n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Data Conversion**: The observed data columns are converted to numpy arrays for easier manipulation.\n2. **Model Definition**: \n   - **MutableData**: `x1` and `x2` are wrapped in `pm.MutableData` containers.\n   - **Priors**: Weakly informative priors are set for the intercept and coefficients.\n   - **Linear Combination**: The linear combination of the inputs is calculated.\n   - **Likelihood**: The observed data \\( y \\) is modeled using a Bernoulli distribution with the probability \\( p \\) derived from the logistic function.\n3. **Sampling**: The model is sampled using `pm.sample` with specified parameters for reproducibility and efficiency. The posterior predictive samples are also generated.\n\nThis initial model should provide a good starting point for understanding the relationship between \\( x1 \\), \\( x2 \\), and \\( y \\). Further iterations can refine the model based on the discrepancies between the actual data and the sampled data.",

Since \\(y\\) is always 1 in the provided data, it suggests that \\(y\\) might be a deterministic function of \\(x1\\) and \\(x2\\). However, we should start with a simple probabilistic model to capture any potential variability.\n\n#### Hypotheses:\n1. \\(y\\) is a deterministic function of \\(x1\\) and \\(x2\\).\n2. \\(y\\) could be modeled as a Bernoulli random variable with a probability that is a function of \\(x1\\) and \\(x2\\).\n\nGiven the data, we will start with a logistic regression model where the probability of \\(y\\) being 1 is modeled using a logistic function of \\(x1\\) and \\(x2\\).\n\n### Plan:\n1. Convert the observed data columns to numpy arrays.\n2. Define a logistic regression model where the probability of \\(y\\) being 1 is a function of \\(x1\\) and \\(x2\\).\n3. Use PyMC to define the probabilistic model and sample from the posterior.\n\n### PyMC Program\n\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x1_data = observed_data['x1'].to_numpy()\n    x2_data = observed_data['x2'].to_numpy()\n    y_data = observed_data['y'].to_numpy()\n    \n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n    \n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create pm.MutableData objects for each non-observation column\n        x1 = pm.MutableData(\"x1\", x1_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        x2 = pm.MutableData(\"x2\", x2_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Define priors for the logistic regression coefficients\n        beta0 = pm.Normal(\"beta0\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta1 = pm.Normal(\"beta1\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta2 = pm.Normal(\"beta2\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        \n        # Define the logistic regression model\n        logit_p = beta0 + beta1 * x1 + beta2 * x2\n        p = pm.Deterministic(\"p\", pm.math.sigmoid(logit_p))\n        \n        # Define the likelihood\n        y_obs = pm.Bernoulli(\"y_obs\", p=p, observed=y_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sample from the posterior\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Data Conversion**: The observed data columns are converted to numpy arrays for easier manipulation.\n2. **Model Definition**: \n   - **MutableData**: `x1` and `x2` are wrapped in `pm.MutableData` to allow for easy updating of the data.\n   - **Priors**: Normal priors are defined for the logistic regression coefficients (`beta0`, `beta1`, `beta2`).\n   - **Logistic Regression**: The logit of the probability `p` is modeled as a linear combination of `x1` and `x2`.\n   - **Likelihood**: The observed data `y` is modeled as a Bernoulli random variable with probability `p`.\n3. **Sampling**: The model samples from the posterior distribution and generates posterior predictive samples.\n\nThis initial model assumes a simple logistic relationship between the inputs and the output. If the model does not fit well, we can revise it in subsequent rounds based on the discrepancies observed."
