A half-normal prior is set for the standard deviation (`sigma`).\n- **Linear Model**: The mean (`mu`) of the normal distribution for `y` is defined as a linear combination of `x1` and `x2`.\n- **Likelihood**: The likelihood of the observations `y_obs` is defined as a normal distribution with mean `mu` and standard deviation `sigma`, with `observed=None` and `dims=\"obs_id\"`.\n- **Prior Predictive Sampling**: Samples are drawn from the prior distribution to check the prior predictive distribution.\n\nThis program sets up a basic linear regression model using PyMC, with the necessary transformations and indexing for the input data.",
            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset and the observations, we need to model the relationship between the input variables \\(x1\\) and \\(x2\\) and the output variable \\(y\\). Since \\(y\\) is always 1 in the provided data, it suggests that \\(y\\) might be a deterministic function of \\(x1\\) and \\(x2\\). However, we should still consider a probabilistic model to account for any potential variability in the data.\n\n#### Hypotheses:\n1. \\(y\\) is a deterministic function of \\(x1\\) and \\(x2\\).\n2. The relationship between \\(x1\\) and \\(x2\\) and \\(y\\) can be modeled using a logistic regression, given the binary nature of \\(y\\).\n\n#### Plan:\n1. Use logistic regression to model the probability of \\(y\\) being 1 given \\(x1\\) and \\(x2\\).\n2. Define priors for the coefficients of \\(x1\\) and \\(x2\\).\n3.
