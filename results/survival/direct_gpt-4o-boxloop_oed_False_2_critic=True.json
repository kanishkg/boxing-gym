The standard deviation (`sigma`) of the noise is defined as a half-normal distribution.\n- **Linear Model:** The mean (`mu`) of the normal distribution for `y` is defined as a linear combination of `x1` and `x2`.\n- **Likelihood:** The likelihood of the observations is defined using a normal distribution with `mu` and `sigma`.\n- **Prior Predictive Sampling:** Samples are drawn from the prior predictive distribution to understand the prior model behavior.\n\nThis program sets up a basic linear regression model with Gaussian noise, which is a reasonable starting point given the information provided.",
            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset and the description, we need to model the binary outcome `y` based on the inputs `x1` and `x2`. Since `y` is binary, a logistic regression model is a suitable choice.
