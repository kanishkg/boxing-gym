            "Based on the data and statistical analysis, we can infer some key insights about the survival of breast cancer patients post-surgery. The model uses logistic regression to predict survival based on two main factors: the time since surgery and whether the cancer has metastasized.\n\n1. **Metastasis Status**: The parameter `beta_metastasized` is significantly positive (3.495), indicating that metastasis greatly reduces the likelihood of survival. Patients whose cancer has metastasized are much less likely to survive compared to those whose cancer has not.\n\n2. **Time Since Surgery**: The parameter `beta_time` is also positive (2.002), suggesting that as more time passes since the surgery, the likelihood of survival decreases. This means that patients who have had surgery more recently are more likely to survive.\n\n3. **Combined Effect**: The intercept (0.392) and the combined effect of both factors (metastasis and time since surgery) are used to calculate the probability of survival. Higher values of both factors (longer time since surgery and presence of metastasis) lead to a higher probability of not surviving.\n\n4. **Predicted Probabilities**: The predicted probabilities (`p[0]` to `p[9]`) show high values close to 1, indicating a high likelihood of not surviving for most patients in the sample. For example, `p[0]` is 0.999, meaning almost certain non-survival.\n\nIn summary, the presence of metastasis and longer time since surgery are strong indicators of lower survival rates. Patients with recent surgeries and no metastasis have a higher chance of survival."

The model uses logistic regression to predict survival based on two main factors: the time since surgery and whether the cancer has metastasized.\n\n1. **Metastasis Status**: The parameter `beta_metastasized` is significantly positive (3.495), indicating that metastasis greatly reduces the likelihood of survival. Patients whose cancer has metastasized are much less likely to survive compared to those whose cancer has not.\n\n2. **Time Since Surgery**: The parameter `beta_time` is also positive (2.002), suggesting that as more time passes since the surgery, the likelihood of survival decreases. This means that patients who have had surgery more recently are more likely to survive.\n\n3. **Combined Effect**: The intercept (0.392) and the combined effect of both factors (metastasis and time since surgery) are used to calculate the probability of survival. Higher values of both factors (longer time since surgery and presence of metastasis) lead to a higher probability of not surviving.\n\n4. **Predicted Probabilities**: The predicted probabilities (`p[0]` to `p[9]`) show high values close to 1, indicating a high likelihood of not surviving for most patients in the sample. For example, `p[0]` is 0.999, meaning almost certain non-survival.\n\nIn summary, the presence of metastasis and longer time since surgery are strong indicators of lower survival rates. Patients with recent surgeries and no metastasis have a higher chance of survival."
