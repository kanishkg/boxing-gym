This will help us cover a broader range of the data space and potentially reveal patterns that are not immediately obvious.\n\nI will start by observing a patient with a relatively short time since surgery and a metastasized status, as this combination might provide insights into the early impact of metastasis on survival.\n</thought>\n<observe>2</observe>",
