Patients whose cancer has metastasized (status = 1) generally have poorer survival outcomes. Metastasis indicates that cancer has spread to other parts of the body, making it more challenging to treat effectively.\n\n2. **Time Since Surgery**: This factor also plays a role, but its impact varies. Patients with no metastasis (status = 0) tend to have better survival rates, especially if they have survived for a moderate duration (around 4-7 years) since surgery. However, even without metastasis, survival is not guaranteed, particularly immediately after surgery or over very long periods.\n\n3. **Combined Factors**: The combination of these two factors is crucial. Patients with metastasis generally have poor survival outcomes regardless of the time since surgery. Conversely, patients without metastasis have a better chance of survival, especially if they have survived the initial years post-surgery.\n\nIn summary, the absence of metastasis is associated with better survival outcomes, particularly in the moderate time range since surgery.
