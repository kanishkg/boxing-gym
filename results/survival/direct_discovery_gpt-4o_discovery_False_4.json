Here are the key patterns identified:\n\n1. **Integer Value of 1**: When the integer value is 1, the binary response is often 1, regardless of the floating-point number's magnitude. For example, tuples like (9.73, 1), (5.47, 1), and (1.64, 1) all resulted in a binary response of 1. However, there are exceptions, such as (2.16, 1), which resulted in a binary response of 0.\n\n2. **Integer Value of 0**: When the integer value is 0, the binary response is more variable. Initially, it seemed that a 0 integer value consistently resulted in a binary response of 0, as seen with tuples like (9.67, 0) and (0.06, 0). However, further observations showed that moderate floating-point numbers with an integer value of 0, such as (5.97, 0) and (5.28, 0), resulted in a binary response of 1.\n\nIn summary, while the integer value of 1 generally leads to a binary response of 1, the integer value of 0 can result in either 0 or 1, influenced by the floating-point number.
