            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset, we need to model the probability of the outcome (whether the patient died) based on the time since surgery and the metastasized status. A logistic regression model is a good starting point for this type of binary outcome data. \n\n**Hypotheses:**\n1. The probability of death (outcome) is influenced by the time since surgery and whether the cancer metastasized.\n2. The relationship between the predictors (time since surgery and metastasized status) and the outcome is logistic.\n\n### Plan\n1. Convert the observed data columns to numpy arrays.\n2. Create a PyMC model with logistic regression.\n3. Define priors for the regression coefficients.\n4. Define the logistic regression likelihood for the observed outcomes.\n5. Sample from the posterior distribution.\n6.

            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset and the initial hypotheses, we need to model the binary outcome of death (`outcome`) based on the time since surgery (`time_surgery`) and whether the cancer metastasized (`metastasized_status`). \n\n**Hypotheses:**\n1. The model might be overestimating the probability of death for patients with certain characteristics, leading to a higher mean in the posterior predictive samples.\n2. The logistic regression model might not be capturing non-linear relationships or interactions between `time_surgery` and `metastasized_status`.\n\n**Synthesis:**\n- The logistic regression model in Program 1 uses `time_surgery` and `metastasized_status` as predictors for the binary outcome of death. The LOO score of -1.2383136435508622 suggests that the model is not performing well in terms of predictive accuracy. The summary statistics from the posterior predictive samples indicate that the model tends to predict a high probability of death (mean values close to 1) for most observations, which might not align with the actual data distribution.\n- Strategies that did not work:\n  - Using a simple logistic regression model with linear terms for `time_surgery` and `metastasized_status` might be insufficient to capture the complexity of the data.\n  - The priors for the regression coefficients (Normal with mu=0 and sigma=10) might be too vague, leading to overfitting or underfitting.\n- Suggestions for improvement:\n  - Consider adding interaction terms or polynomial terms to capture potential non-linear relationships between `time_surgery` and `metastasized_status`.\n  - Explore alternative models such as hierarchical models or models with more informative priors based on domain knowledge.\n  - Evaluate the inclusion of additional covariates or transformations of existing covariates to improve model fit.\n  - Perform model diagnostics to identify specific areas where the model is underperforming and adjust the model structure accordingly.\n\n### Plan\n1. **Model Structure**: Use a logistic regression model with interaction terms and polynomial terms to capture non-linear relationships.\n2. **Priors**: Use more informative priors based on domain knowledge.\n3. **Transformations**: Apply transformations to the input features if necessary.\n\n### Program\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    time_surgery = observed_data['time_surgery'].values\n    metastasized_status = observed_data['metastasized_status'].values\n    outcome = observed_data['outcome'].values\n\n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n\n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create pm.MutableData objects for each non-observation column\n        time_surgery_data = pm.MutableData(\"time_surgery\", time_surgery, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        metastasized_status_data = pm.MutableData(\"metastasized_status\", metastasized_status, dims=\"obs_id\")\n\n        # Priors for the regression coefficients\n        beta_0 = pm.Normal(\"beta_0\", mu=0, sigma=1)\n        beta_1 = pm.Normal(\"beta_1\", mu=0, sigma=1)\n        beta_2 = pm.Normal(\"beta_2\", mu=0, sigma=1)\n        beta_3 = pm.Normal(\"beta_3\", mu=0, sigma=1)  # Interaction term\n        beta_4 = pm.Normal(\"beta_4\", mu=0, sigma=1)  # Polynomial term\n\n        # Linear combination with interaction and polynomial terms\n        linear_combination = (\n            beta_0 +\n            beta_1 * time_surgery_data +\n            beta_2 * metastasized_status_data +\n            beta_3 * time_surgery_data * metastasized_status_data +\n            beta_4 * time_surgery_data**2\n        )\n\n        # Logistic regression likelihood\n        p = pm.Deterministic(\"p\", pm.math.sigmoid(linear_combination))\n        y_obs = pm.Bernoulli(\"y_obs\", p=p, observed=outcome, dims=\"obs_id\")\n\n        # Sampling\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n\n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Model Structure**: The model includes interaction terms (`beta_3 * time_surgery_data * metastasized_status_data`) and polynomial terms (`beta_4 * time_surgery_data**2`) to capture non-linear relationships.\n- **Priors**: More informative priors (Normal with `mu=0` and `sigma=1`) are used for the regression coefficients.\n- **Transformations**: Polynomial terms are included to capture non-linear effects.\n\nThis model should better capture the complexity of the data and address the hypotheses and synthesis provided.",
