            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset and the description, we need to model the relationship between the input variables \\(x1\\) and \\(x2\\) and the observed output \\(y\\). Since \\(y\\) is binary (0 or 1), a logistic regression model is a suitable choice.
