            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset and the nature of the problem, we need to model the probability of a patient's death (outcome) based on the time since surgery and metastasized status. A logistic regression model is a good starting point for this type of binary outcome data. \n\n**Hypotheses:**\n1. The probability of death (outcome) is influenced by the time since surgery and whether the cancer metastasized.\n2.
