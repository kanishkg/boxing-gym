            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset and the description, we need to model the relationship between the inputs \\( x1 \\) and \\( x2 \\) and the output \\( y \\). Since \\( y \\) is binary (0 or 1), a logistic regression model is a suitable choice. This model will allow us to estimate the probability of \\( y \\) being 1 given \\( x1 \\) and \\( x2 \\).\n\n1. **Modeling Approach**:\n   - Use a logistic regression model where the probability of \\( y \\) being 1 is modeled using a logistic function.\n   - The logistic function will take a linear combination of \\( x1 \\) and \\( x2 \\) as input.\n   - The coefficients of the linear combination (intercept and slopes) will be given prior distributions.\n\n2. **Priors**:\n   - Use normal priors for the intercept and slopes.\n\n3. **Likelihood**:\n   - Use a Bernoulli distribution for \\( y \\) with the probability parameter given by the logistic function.\n\n### Probabilistic Program\n\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x1_data = observed_data['x1'].values\n    x2_data = observed_data['x2'].values\n    y_data = observed_data['y'].values\n\n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create pm.MutableData objects for each non-observation column\n        x1 = pm.MutableData(\"x1\", x1_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        x2 = pm.MutableData(\"x2\", x2_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Priors for the logistic regression coefficients\n        intercept = pm.Normal(\"intercept\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        slope_x1 = pm.Normal(\"slope_x1\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        slope_x2 = pm.Normal(\"slope_x2\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        \n        # Linear combination of inputs\n        linear_combination = intercept + slope_x1 * x1 + slope_x2 * x2\n        \n        # Logistic function to get probabilities\n        p = pm.Deterministic(\"p\", pm.math.sigmoid(linear_combination))\n        \n        # Likelihood\n        y_obs = pm.Bernoulli(\"y_obs\", p=p, observed=y_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sampling\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=np.random.default_rng(42), idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=np.random.default_rng(314), return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **Data Conversion**: The observed data columns are converted to numpy arrays for easier manipulation.\n- **MutableData Objects**: `x1` and `x2` are wrapped in `pm.MutableData` containers to allow for future updates if needed.\n- **Priors**: Normal priors are assigned to the intercept and slopes of the logistic regression model.\n- **Linear Combination**: A linear combination of the inputs \\( x1 \\) and \\( x2 \\) is computed.\n- **Logistic Function**: The logistic function (sigmoid) is applied to the linear combination to get the probabilities.\n- **Likelihood**: The observed data \\( y \\) is modeled using a Bernoulli distribution with the computed probabilities.\n- **Sampling**: The model is sampled using `pm.sample` with specified parameters for reproducibility and efficiency. The posterior predictive samples are also generated.\n\nThis initial model should provide a good starting point for understanding the relationship between \\( x1 \\), \\( x2 \\), and \\( y \\). Further iterations can refine the model based on the discrepancies between the actual data and the sampled data.",
            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset and the description, we need to model the relationship between the inputs \\(x1\\) and \\(x2\\) and the output \\(y\\). The output \\(y\\) appears to be binary (0 or 1), suggesting a logistic regression model might be appropriate. \n\n#### Hypotheses:\n1. The output \\(y\\) is a binary variable dependent on \\(x1\\) and \\(x2\\).\n2. The relationship between \\(x1\\), \\(x2\\), and \\(y\\) can be modeled using a logistic regression.\n\n### Plan:\n1. Use a logistic regression model where the probability of \\(y = 1\\) is given by a logistic function of a linear combination of \\(x1\\) and \\(x2\\).\n2. Define priors for the coefficients and intercept.\n3. Use the observed data to fit the model and sample from the posterior.\n\n### Program:\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x1_data = observed_data['x1'].values\n    x2_data = observed_data['x2'].values\n    y_data = observed_data['y'].values\n    \n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n    \n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create pm.MutableData objects for each non-observation column\n        x1 = pm.MutableData(\"x1\", x1_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        x2 = pm.MutableData(\"x2\", x2_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Define priors for the coefficients and intercept\n        intercept = pm.Normal(\"intercept\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta_x1 = pm.Normal(\"beta_x1\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta_x2 = pm.Normal(\"beta_x2\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        \n        # Define the linear combination\n        linear_combination = intercept + beta_x1 * x1 + beta_x2 * x2\n        \n        # Define the likelihood using a Bernoulli distribution\n        p = pm.Deterministic(\"p\", pm.math.sigmoid(linear_combination))\n        y_obs = pm.Bernoulli(\"y_obs\", p=p, observed=y_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sample from the posterior\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Data Conversion**: Convert the columns of the observed data to numpy arrays for easier manipulation.\n2. **Model Definition**: \n   - **MutableData**: Create `pm.MutableData` objects for `x1` and `x2` to allow for easy updating of the data.\n   - **Priors**: Define normal priors for the intercept and coefficients (`beta_x1` and `beta_x2`).\n   - **Linear Combination**: Define the linear combination of the inputs.\n   - **Likelihood**: Use a Bernoulli distribution for the likelihood, with the probability given by the logistic function of the linear combination.\n3. **Sampling**: Sample from the posterior distribution and the posterior predictive distribution.\n\nThis initial model assumes a simple logistic regression relationship between the inputs and the output. We will revise this model based on the discrepancies between the actual data and the sampled data in subsequent rounds."
