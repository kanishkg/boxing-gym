The dataset includes 100 patients, each with a specified time since surgery and a metastasis status (0 for no metastasis, 1 for metastasis).\n\nTo make predictions, consider the following:\n\n1. **Time Since Surgery**: Patients with shorter times since surgery may have different survival outcomes compared to those with longer times. For example, a patient with a time since surgery of 0.51 years (ID 8) is alive, while others with short times (e.g., 1.26 years, ID 6) are dead.\n\n2. **Metastasis Status**: Metastasis significantly impacts survival. Patients with metastasis (e.g., ID 2 with 2.91 years) are often dead, but this is not always the case.\n\n3. **Combination of Factors**: Both factors together provide a clearer picture. For instance, patients with no metastasis and varying times since surgery show different outcomes. A patient with no metastasis and a short time since surgery (ID 8) is alive, while another with a similar profile (ID 6) is dead.\n\nIn summary, both the time since surgery and metastasis status are crucial for predicting survival.
