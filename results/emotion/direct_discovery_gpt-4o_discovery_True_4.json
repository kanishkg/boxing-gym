            "To predict how the participant thinks the player feels after each spin of the wheel, consider both the prize value and the probability of winning it. Here are some key insights:\n\n1. **High Prize, High Probability**: If the player wins the highest prize with the highest probability, they are likely to feel quite happy and somewhat surprised. The high reward meets their expectations but still brings joy.\n\n2. **High Prize, Low Probability**: Winning the highest prize with a low probability makes the player feel very happy and pleasantly surprised. The unexpected high reward amplifies their positive emotions.\n\n3. **Mid Prize, Moderate Probability**: Winning a mid-value prize with a moderate probability results in the player feeling fairly happy and content, with a touch of surprise. The outcome is good but not the best, leading to mixed emotions.\n\n4. **Low Prize, High Probability**: If the player wins the lowest prize with the highest probability, they are likely to feel quite disappointed and somewhat sad. The low reward, despite being expected, is still undesirable.\n\n5. **Low Prize, Low Probability**: Winning the lowest prize with a low probability makes the player feel quite disappointed and somewhat surprised. The unlikely but low reward leads to strong negative emotions.\n\nBy considering these patterns, you can predict the participant's assessment of the player's emotions based on the prize value and its probability."
