            "To predict how the participant thinks the player feels after each spin of the wheel, consider the following factors:\n\n1. **Prize Values**: Higher prize values generally lead to more positive emotions, while lower prize values lead to more negative emotions. For example, winning the highest prize (e.g., 100) often results in feelings of elation and pleasant surprise, while winning the lowest prize (e.g., 10) can lead to sadness and disappointment.\n\n2. **Probabilities**: The likelihood of each prize affects the player's emotional response. If a high prize is less likely (e.g., 0.2 probability), winning it can lead to greater surprise and joy. Conversely, if a low prize is more likely (e.g., 0.5 probability), winning it might result in mild contentment but also slight disappointment.\n\n3. **Expectations**: The player's emotions are influenced by their expectations based on the probabilities. Winning a middle prize (e.g., 50) with a moderate probability (e.g., 0.3) often results in moderate happiness and contentment, as it aligns fairly well with expectations.\n\nBy considering these factors\u2014prize values, probabilities, and expectations\u2014you can predict that higher prizes generally lead to more positive emotions, lower prizes to more negative emotions, and middle prizes to moderate emotions, all influenced by the likelihood of each outcome."
