            "To predict how the participant thinks the player feels after each spin of the wheel, consider two main factors: the prize value and the probability of winning that prize.\n\n1. **Prize Value**: Higher prize values generally lead to more positive emotions. For example, winning the highest prize (e.g., 90) usually makes the player feel very happy and content. Conversely, winning the lowest prize (e.g., 10) often results in disappointment or mild sadness.\n\n2. **Probability**: The likelihood of winning a particular prize affects the player's emotional response. Unexpected outcomes (low probability) tend to evoke stronger emotions, whether positive or negative. For instance, winning a high prize with a low probability (e.g., 10%) can lead to feelings of surprise and joy. On the other hand, winning a low prize with a low probability can lead to surprise and disappointment.\n\n3. **Combination of Factors**: The participant's predictions are influenced by the combination of prize value and probability. A high prize with a high probability (e.g., 70%) might result in happiness but less surprise. A low prize with a high probability might lead to mild disappointment but not much surprise.\n\nBy considering these factors, you can better predict how the participant thinks the player feels after each spin."

The participant's previous response indicated that the player might feel somewhat surprised and sad when the outcome is the most common but least desirable one. In this case, the outcome is not the most common, but it is still relatively low in value. Therefore, the player might feel a mix of mild surprise and disappointment, with some sadness due to the low prize value.\n\nConsidering these factors, the emotions can be predicted as follows:\n- Happiness: Low, because the prize value is low.\n- Sadness: Moderate, due to the low prize value.\n- Anger: Low, as there is no indication of strong negative feelings.\n- Surprise: Moderate, because the outcome is not the most common.\n- Fear: Low, as there is no reason for the player to feel fear.\n- Disgust: Low, as there is no indication of strong negative feelings.\n- Contentment: Low, because the prize value is low.\n- Disappointment: Moderate, due to the low prize value.\n\n</thought>\n<answer>\nHappiness: 2/9\nSadness: 5/9\nAnger: 2/9\nSurprise: 4/9\nFear: 1/9\nDisgust: 2/9\nContentment: 2/9\nDisappointment: 5/9\n</answer>",
