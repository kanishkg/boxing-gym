            "To predict how the participant thinks the player feels after each spin of the wheel, consider both the prize value and the probability of winning that prize. Here are some key insights based on the participant's responses:\n\n1. **High Prize, High Probability**: If the player wins the highest prize with a high probability, they are likely to feel quite happy but not extremely surprised. The high value brings joy, but the high probability tempers the surprise.\n\n2. **High Prize, Low Probability**: If the player wins the highest prize with a low probability, they are likely to feel ecstatic and very surprised. The combination of a high value and low likelihood amplifies both happiness and surprise.\n\n3. **Low Prize, High Probability**: If the player wins the lowest prize with a high probability, they are likely to feel slightly sad and mildly surprised. The low value brings disappointment, but the high probability makes it somewhat expected.\n\n4. **Low Prize, Low Probability**: If the player wins the lowest prize with a low probability, they are likely to feel quite sad and disappointed. The low value combined with low likelihood heightens the negative emotions.\n\n5. **Middle Prize, Moderate Probability**: If the player wins a middle prize with a moderate probability, they are likely to feel moderately happy and slightly surprised. The outcome is neither the best nor the worst, leading to balanced emotions.\n\nBy considering these patterns, you can predict the participant's perception of the player's emotions based on the prize value and its probability."
