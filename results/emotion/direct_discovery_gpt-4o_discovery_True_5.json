            "To predict how the participant thinks the player feels after each spin of the wheel, consider the following key points:\n\n1. **Prize Value and Probability**: The participant's interpretation of the player's emotions is influenced by both the prize value and its probability. Higher prize values generally lead to more positive emotions, while lower prize values lead to more negative emotions.\n\n2. **Expectation vs. Outcome**: The participant considers whether the outcome was expected based on its probability. Winning a high prize with a low probability often results in feelings of surprise and excitement, while winning a low prize with a high probability can lead to disappointment.\n\n3. **Moderate Outcomes**: When the player wins a middle prize, the participant tends to describe the player's emotions as moderately happy and content, with some element of surprise, regardless of the probability distribution.\n\n4. **Balanced Probabilities**: In scenarios where probabilities are evenly distributed, the participant's responses indicate that the player's emotions are influenced more by the prize value than by the probability.\n\n5. **Skewed Probabilities**: When probabilities are highly skewed, the participant's interpretation emphasizes the unexpected nature of the outcome, leading to stronger emotional reactions.\n\nBy considering these factors, you can predict how the participant thinks the player feels after each spin of the wheel."
