The binary response is influenced by a linear combination of `x1` and `x2`.\n2. The relationship between the predictors (`x1`, `x2`) and the binary response can be captured using a logistic regression model.\n\n### Plan:\n1. Convert the observed data columns to numpy arrays.\n2.

Convert the log-odds to probabilities (`p`) using the sigmoid function.\n   - **Likelihood**: Define the likelihood of the observed data (`y_obs`) as a Bernoulli distribution with probability `p`.\n3. **Sampling**: Draw samples from the posterior distribution and the posterior predictive distribution for model evaluation.\n\nThis initial model should provide a good starting point for understanding the relationship between the predictors and the binary response.
