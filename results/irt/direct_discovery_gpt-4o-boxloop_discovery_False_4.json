The output is influenced by a combination of the two input values. Specifically, the model suggests that the output is determined by a linear combination of the inputs, adjusted by certain coefficients and an intercept.\n\nFrom the inferred parameters:\n- The intercept is 1.722, which means there is a baseline tendency towards an output of 1.\n- The coefficient for the first input (beta_x1) is 0.292, indicating a positive contribution to the output.\n- The coefficient for the second input (beta_x2) is -0.517, indicating a negative contribution to the output.\n\nThe probability of the output being 1 is calculated using a logistic function applied to this linear combination. This means that higher values of the first input increase the likelihood of a 1, while higher values of the second input decrease it.\n\nFrom our observations:\n- Inputs with at least one value of 3 tend to result in an output of 0.\n- Other combinations generally result in an output of 1.\n\nTo predict the output:\n- If either input is 3, the output is likely 0.\n- For other combinations, the output is likely 1."
