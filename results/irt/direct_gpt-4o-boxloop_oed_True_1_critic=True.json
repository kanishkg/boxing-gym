            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset and the problem description, we need to model the binary correctness of students' answers to questions. A reasonable starting point is to use a logistic regression model where the probability of a correct answer depends on both the student and the question. This allows us to capture the varying difficulty of questions and the varying abilities of students.\n\n#### Hypotheses:\n1. The correctness of a student's answer to a question depends on the student's ability and the question's difficulty.\n2. The abilities of students and the difficulties of questions can be modeled as latent variables.\n\n### Plan:\n1. **Latent Variables**:\n   - `student_ability`: A latent variable representing the ability of each student.\n   - `question_difficulty`: A latent variable representing the difficulty of each question.\n\n2. **Likelihood**:\n   - The probability of a correct answer is modeled using a logistic function of the difference between student ability and question difficulty.\n\n3. **Priors**:\n   - Use normal priors for both student abilities and question difficulties.\n\n### Program:\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    student_ids = observed_data['student_id'].values\n    question_ids = observed_data['question_id'].values\n    correctness = observed_data['correctness'].values\n\n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n\n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create pm.MutableData objects for each non-observation column\n        student_id = pm.MutableData(\"student_id\", student_ids, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        question_id = pm.MutableData(\"question_id\", question_ids, dims=\"obs_id\")\n\n        # Latent variables for student abilities and question difficulties\n        student_ability = pm.Normal(\"student_ability\", mu=0, sigma=1, shape=6)\n        question_difficulty = pm.Normal(\"question_difficulty\", mu=0, sigma=1, shape=6)\n\n        # Logistic regression model for the probability of correctness\n        logit_p = student_ability[student_id] - question_difficulty[question_id]\n        p = pm.Deterministic(\"p\", pm.math.sigmoid(logit_p))\n\n        # Likelihood\n        y_obs = pm.Bernoulli(\"y_obs\", p=p, observed=correctness, dims=\"obs_id\")\n\n        # Sampling\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n\n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Latent Variables**: `student_ability` and `question_difficulty` are modeled as normal distributions with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.\n- **Logistic Regression**: The probability of a correct answer is modeled using a logistic function of the difference between student ability and question difficulty.\n- **Likelihood**: The observed correctness is modeled as a Bernoulli random variable with the probability `p`.\n\nThis model captures the intuition that a student's ability and a question's difficulty jointly determine the probability of a correct answer. The logistic function ensures that the probability is between 0 and 1.",

            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset and the hypotheses, we need to model the probability of a student answering a question correctly. The initial model will assume that the probability of a correct answer is determined by the difference between student ability and question difficulty. \n\n1. **Student Abilities and Question Difficulties**: We will model student abilities and question difficulties as normally distributed random variables. This will allow us to capture the inherent variability in both student performance and question difficulty.\n\n2. **Logistic Regression**: To account for the binary nature of the correctness data, we will use a logistic regression model. This will allow us to model the probability of a correct answer as a function of the difference between student ability and question difficulty.\n\n3. **Priors**: We will use normal priors for both student abilities and question difficulties. This is a reasonable starting point, and we can refine these priors in subsequent rounds if necessary.\n\n### Probabilistic Program\n\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    student_ids = observed_data['student_id'].values\n    question_ids = observed_data['question_id'].values\n    correctness = observed_data['correctness'].values\n\n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n\n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create pm.MutableData objects for each non-observation column\n        student_id = pm.MutableData(\"student_id\", student_ids, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        question_id = pm.MutableData(\"question_id\", question_ids, dims=\"obs_id\")\n\n        # Priors for student abilities and question difficulties\n        student_ability = pm.Normal(\"student_ability\", mu=0, sigma=1, shape=6)\n        question_difficulty = pm.Normal(\"question_difficulty\", mu=0, sigma=1, shape=6)\n\n        # Linear model for the probability of correctness\n        ability_diff = student_ability[student_id] - question_difficulty[question_id]\n        p = pm.Deterministic(\"p\", pm.math.sigmoid(ability_diff))\n\n        # Likelihood of the observations\n        y_obs = pm.Bernoulli(\"y_obs\", p=p, observed=correctness, dims=\"obs_id\")\n\n        # Sampling\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n\n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Data Conversion**: The observed data columns are converted to numpy arrays for easier manipulation.\n2. **MutableData Objects**: `student_id` and `question_id` are wrapped in `pm.MutableData` containers to allow for easy indexing and updating.\n3. **Priors**: We use normal priors for `student_ability` and `question_difficulty`, assuming that both follow a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.\n4. **Logistic Regression**: The probability of a correct answer is modeled using a logistic function applied to the difference between student ability and question difficulty.\n5. **Likelihood**: The observed correctness data is modeled using a Bernoulli distribution with the probability `p`.\n6. **Sampling**: We sample from the posterior distribution and generate posterior predictive samples for model evaluation.\n\nThis initial model provides a solid foundation, and we can refine it in subsequent rounds based on the feedback and discrepancies observed between the actual data and the sampled data."
