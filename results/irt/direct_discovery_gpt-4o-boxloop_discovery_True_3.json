            "To predict whether a student will answer a specific question correctly, we can consider two main factors: the student's ability and the question's difficulty. Each student has a certain ability level, and each question has a certain difficulty level. The likelihood of a student answering a question correctly depends on the difference between the student's ability and the question's difficulty.\n\nFrom the data, we have inferred the following abilities for the students:\n- Student 0: -0.062\n- Student 1: -0.605\n- Student 2: -0.654\n- Student 3: 0.672\n- Student 4: 0.400\n- Student 5: -0.360\n\nAnd the following difficulties for the questions:\n- Question 0: 0.317\n- Question 1: 0.097\n- Question 2: -0.023\n- Question 3: -0.635\n- Question 4: 0.539\n- Question 5: 0.345\n\nA positive student ability indicates a higher likelihood of answering correctly, while a positive question difficulty indicates a harder question. For example, Student 3, with a high ability (0.672), is more likely to answer questions correctly, especially easier ones like Question 3 (-0.635). Conversely, Student 2, with a low ability (-0.654), is less likely to answer questions correctly, particularly harder ones like Question 4 (0.539).\n\nTo predict correctness, compare the student's ability to the question's difficulty: if the ability is higher than the difficulty, the student is likely to answer correctly, and vice versa."
