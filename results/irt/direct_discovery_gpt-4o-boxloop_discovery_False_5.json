            "Based on the observations and the inferred parameters from the statistical model, we can make some educated guesses about the environment's behavior.\n\nThe environment maps two integers, each ranging from 0 to 5, to a boolean output (0 or 1). The statistical model suggests that the output is influenced by a combination of the two integers, with different weights assigned to each integer. Specifically, the model uses an intercept and coefficients for each integer to calculate a probability, which is then used to determine the boolean output.\n\nFrom the inferred parameters:\n- The intercept is approximately 0.201.\n- The coefficient for the first integer (beta_x1) is approximately -1.388.\n- The coefficient for the second integer (beta_x2) is approximately 1.581.\n\nThis means that the second integer has a stronger positive influence on the output, while the first integer has a negative influence. When the second integer is high (closer to 5), the probability of the output being 1 increases. Conversely, when the first integer is high, the probability of the output being 1 decreases.\n\nIn practical terms:\n- If the second integer is 5, the output is likely to be 1.\n- If both integers are the same and relatively low (e.g., 1 or 2), the output is likely to be 1.\n- If both integers are the same and relatively high (e.g., 3 or 4), the output is likely to be 0.\n\nBy understanding these patterns, you can make more reliable predictions about the boolean output for different integer inputs."
