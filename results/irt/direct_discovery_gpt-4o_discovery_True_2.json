This suggests that question 0 might be relatively easy for most students but not universally so.\n- **Question 1**: Answered correctly by students 0, 1, 2, and 3, indicating that question 1 is likely easier or more straightforward for the students.\n- **Question 2**: Answered correctly by student 1 but incorrectly by student 2. This suggests that question 2 might be more challenging or that performance varies more significantly among students.\n\n**General Observations**:\n- Students 0 and 1 seem to perform well across multiple questions.\n- Student 2 shows inconsistency, performing well on some questions but poorly on others.\n- Student 3 has shown good performance on the questions tested so far.\n\nThese patterns can help predict the likelihood of a student answering a specific question correctly."
