            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset description, we have a binary response to a tuple of two positive integer values. This suggests a logistic regression model where the response variable follows a Bernoulli distribution with a probability parameter that is a function of the two input values.\n\n**Hypotheses:**\n1. The response variable is binary and follows a Bernoulli distribution.\n2. The probability of the response being 1 is modeled using a logistic function of the two input values.\n\n### Plan:\n1. Convert the observed data columns to numpy arrays.\n2. Create a `pm.MutableData` object for each non-observation column.\n3. Define the logistic regression model:\n   - Define priors for the coefficients and intercept.\n   - Compute the linear combination of the input values.\n   - Apply the logistic function to get the probability.\n   - Define the Bernoulli likelihood for the binary response.\n4. Sample from the prior predictive distribution.\n\n### Program:\n\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x1_data = observed_data['x1'].to_numpy()\n    x2_data = observed_data['x2'].to_numpy()\n    \n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n    \n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create a pm.MutableData object for each non-observation column\n        x1 = pm.MutableData(\"x1\", x1_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        x2 = pm.MutableData(\"x2\", x2_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Define priors for the coefficients and intercept\n        intercept = pm.Normal(\"intercept\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta_x1 = pm.Normal(\"beta_x1\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta_x2 = pm.Normal(\"beta_x2\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        \n        # Compute the linear combination of the input values\n        linear_combination = intercept + beta_x1 * x1 + beta_x2 * x2\n        \n        # Apply the logistic function to get the probability\n        p = pm.Deterministic(\"p\", pm.math.sigmoid(linear_combination))\n        \n        # Define the Bernoulli likelihood for the binary response\n        y_obs = pm.Bernoulli(\"y_obs\", p=p, observed=None, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sample from the prior predictive distribution\n        prior_predictive = pm.sample_prior_predictive(samples=1000, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, prior_predictive\n\n# Note: This function assumes that the observed_data DataFrame has columns named 'x1' and 'x2'.\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **MutableData Objects:** `x1` and `x2` are wrapped in `pm.MutableData` to allow for future updates.\n- **Priors:** Normal priors are set for the intercept and coefficients.\n- **Linear Combination:** The linear combination of the input values is computed.\n- **Logistic Function:** The logistic function is applied to get the probability of the binary response.\n- **Likelihood:** The binary response is modeled using a Bernoulli distribution with the computed probability.\n- **Prior Predictive Sampling:** Samples are drawn from the prior predictive distribution to check the model's prior assumptions.",
            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the binary nature of the response variable \\( y \\) and the two positive integer predictors \\( x1 \\) and \\( x2 \\), a logistic regression model is a reasonable starting point. Logistic regression is a classic model for binary outcomes and can capture the relationship between the predictors and the response.\n\n### Plan\n1. **Model Choice**: Use logistic regression to model the probability of \\( y \\) being 1.\n2. **Priors**: Use weakly informative priors for the coefficients to allow the data to inform the posterior.\n3. **Likelihood**: Use a Bernoulli distribution for the binary response variable \\( y \\).\n\n### Program\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x1_data = observed_data['x1'].values\n    x2_data = observed_data['x2'].values\n    y_data = observed_data['y'].values\n\n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n    \n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create pm.MutableData objects for each non-observation column\n        x1 = pm.MutableData(\"x1\", x1_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        x2 = pm.MutableData(\"x2\", x2_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Priors for the coefficients\n        beta0 = pm.Normal(\"beta0\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta1 = pm.Normal(\"beta1\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta2 = pm.Normal(\"beta2\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        \n        # Linear combination\n        logit_p = beta0 + beta1 * x1 + beta2 * x2\n        \n        # Likelihood\n        p = pm.Deterministic(\"p\", pm.math.sigmoid(logit_p))\n        y_obs = pm.Bernoulli(\"y_obs\", p=p, observed=y_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sampling\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Priors**: We use normal priors with mean 0 and standard deviation 10 for the intercept and coefficients. This is a weakly informative prior that allows the data to inform the posterior.\n- **Likelihood**: The likelihood is modeled using a Bernoulli distribution with the probability parameter \\( p \\) derived from the logistic function applied to the linear combination of the predictors.\n- **Sampling**: We sample from the posterior distribution using 1000 samples with 500 tuning steps, setting `target_accept` to 0.90 for better convergence. We also sample from the posterior predictive distribution to generate predictions.\n\nThis model should provide a good starting point for understanding the relationship between \\( x1 \\), \\( x2 \\), and the binary response \\( y \\).",
