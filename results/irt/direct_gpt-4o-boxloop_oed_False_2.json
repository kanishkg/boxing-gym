Let's denote these two integer values as `x1` and `x2`. The binary response can be modeled using a logistic regression approach, where the probability of the binary outcome is determined by a logistic function applied to a linear combination of `x1` and `x2`.\n\n#### Hypotheses:\n1. The binary response is influenced by a linear combination of `x1` and `x2`.\n2. The relationship between the predictors (`x1`, `x2`) and the binary response can be captured using a logistic regression model.\n\n### Plan:\n1. Convert the observed data columns `x1` and `x2` to numpy arrays.\n2. Define a logistic regression model where the probability of the binary response is determined by a linear combination of `x1` and `x2`.\n3. Use `pm.MutableData` to handle the input features `x1` and `x2`.\n4. Define the likelihood of the binary response using a Bernoulli distribution with the probability parameter derived from the logistic function.\n5.

The posterior predictive samples are also generated.\n\nThis initial model should provide a good starting point for understanding the relationship between the predictors and the binary response.
