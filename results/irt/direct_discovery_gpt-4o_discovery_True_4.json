This suggests that student 1's performance may vary depending on the question.\n\n4. **Student 4**: Answered question 0 correctly but answered question 1 incorrectly. This indicates that student 4's performance also varies by question.\n\nFrom these observations, it appears that some questions (like question 1 and question 0) might be easier for a majority of students, but individual performance can vary.
