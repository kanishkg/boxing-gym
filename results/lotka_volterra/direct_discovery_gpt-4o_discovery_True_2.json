            "To predict the population counts of predators and prey at any given time, we need to understand the cyclical nature of their interactions. Based on the observations:\n\n1. **Initial Phase (Time 0-10)**: The prey population starts high and decreases, while the predator population increases. This suggests that predators thrive when prey is abundant, leading to a decline in prey due to predation.\n\n2. **Middle Phase (Time 10-25)**: As the prey population decreases, the predator population also starts to decline due to a lack of food. This allows the prey population to stabilize and then begin to recover.\n\n3. **Recovery Phase (Time 25-35)**: With fewer predators, the prey population increases significantly. The predator population starts to recover slowly as more prey becomes available.\n\n4. **Recent Phase (Time 35-40)**: The prey population begins to decrease again as the predator population increases, indicating a resurgence of predation.\n\nThis cyclical pattern suggests that predator and prey populations are interdependent. When prey is abundant, predator numbers grow, leading to a decline in prey. As prey becomes scarce, predator numbers fall, allowing prey to recover. This cycle repeats over time.\n\nTo predict future populations, consider the current phase of the cycle and the observed trends. For example, if prey is currently increasing and predators are low, expect predator numbers to rise soon, followed by a decrease in prey."
