            "To predict the populations of predators and prey over time, we can observe a cyclical pattern in their interactions. Initially, the prey population starts high, and the predator population is moderate. As time progresses, the prey population decreases due to predation, leading to a decline in the predator population due to a lack of food. When the predator population is low, the prey population begins to recover due to reduced predation pressure. This recovery allows the predator population to increase again, repeating the cycle.\n\nKey observations:\n1. At time 0, prey: 40, predators: 9.\n2. By time 5, prey: 31, predators: 5.\n3. By time 10, prey: 37, predators: 2.\n4. By time 15, prey: 52, predators: 2.\n5. By time 20, prey: 70, predators: 3.\n6. By time 25, prey: 67, predators: 8.\n7. By time 30, prey: 39, predators: 9.\n8.
