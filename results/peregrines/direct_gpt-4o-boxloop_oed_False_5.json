            "Let's start by sketching a high-level probabilistic program for the data. Since we only have one input feature `x1` and one output `y`, we can assume a simple linear relationship between `x1` and `y` with some noise. \n\n### High-Level Probabilistic Program\n1. **Model the relationship between `x1` and `y`**:\n   - Assume `y` is linearly dependent on `x1` with some noise.\n   - The linear relationship can be modeled as `y = a * x1 + b + \u03b5`, where `a` and `b` are parameters to be estimated, and `\u03b5` is the noise term.\n2. **Define priors for the parameters**:\n   - `a` (slope) can be modeled with a normal prior.\n   - `b` (intercept) can be modeled with a normal prior.\n   - The noise term `\u03b5` can be modeled with a normal distribution with mean 0 and some standard deviation `sigma`.\n3. **Define the likelihood**:\n   - The observed data `y` can be modeled as normally distributed around the linear relationship with standard deviation `sigma`.\n\n### Probabilistic Program\nNow, let's write the probabilistic program using PyMC. We'll follow the template provided and ensure we adhere to all the important instructions.\n\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x1_data = observed_data['x1'].to_numpy()\n    \n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n    \n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create a pm.MutableData object for each non-observation column\n        x1 = pm.MutableData(\"x1\", x1_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Define priors for the parameters\n        a = pm.Normal(\"a\", mu=0, sigma=1)  # Slope\n        b = pm.Normal(\"b\", mu=0, sigma=1)  # Intercept\n        sigma = pm.HalfNormal(\"sigma\", sigma=1)  # Noise standard deviation\n        \n        # Define the linear relationship\n        mu = a * x1 + b\n        \n        # Define the likelihood\n        y_obs = pm.Normal(\"y_obs\", mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=None, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sample from the prior\n        prior_predictive = pm.sample_prior_predictive(samples=1000, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, prior_predictive\n\n# Example usage (assuming observed_data is a pandas DataFrame with the appropriate columns)\n# observed_data = pd.DataFrame({'x1': np.random.randn(100)})\n# model, prior_predictive = gen_model(observed_data)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n- **MutableData**: We create a `pm.MutableData` object for `x1` to allow for easy updating of the data.\n- **Priors**: We define normal priors for the slope (`a`) and intercept (`b`), and a half-normal prior for the noise standard deviation (`sigma`).\n- **Linear Relationship**: We model the mean `mu` of the normal distribution for `y` as a linear function of `x1`.\n- **Likelihood**: We define the likelihood of the observed data `y_obs` as normally distributed around `mu` with standard deviation `sigma`.\n- **Prior Predictive Sampling**: We sample from the prior to generate prior predictive distributions.\n\nThis program should be a good starting point for modeling the relationship between `x1` and `y`. If you have any additional information or hypotheses, we can refine the model further.",

Conduct experiments to learn about the environment and make predictions based on your observations.\nYou may observe the value of the function one input value at a time. Make observations by specifying a single value you want to observe with a float number.\nThe environment will return the integer response of the function at that input.\nThe input values are between 0 and 5.\n\nHere is an example:\n<thought> your thought </thought>\n<observe>2</observe>\nWhen asked to answer a question about the environment, respond in the format specified in the question.\nExample:\n<thought> your thought </thought>\n<answer> your answer </answer>\n",
