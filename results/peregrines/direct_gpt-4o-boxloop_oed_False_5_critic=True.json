            "Let's start by sketching a high-level probabilistic program for the data. Since we only have one input column `x1` and one output column `y`, we can assume a simple linear relationship between `x1` and `y` for our initial model. \n\n### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\n1. **Model Assumptions:**\n   - Assume a linear relationship between `x1` and `y`.\n   - The output `y` is normally distributed around a linear function of `x1` with some noise.\n\n2. **Model Components:**\n   - **Priors:**\n     - Intercept (`alpha`): Normally distributed with mean 0 and a large standard deviation.\n     - Slope (`beta`): Normally distributed with mean 0 and a large standard deviation.\n     - Noise (`sigma`): Half-normal distribution to ensure non-negativity.\n   - **Likelihood:**\n     - `y` is normally distributed with mean `alpha + beta * x1` and standard deviation `sigma`.\n\n### Probabilistic Program\n\nNow, let's write the program in PyMC:\n\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x1_data = observed_data['x1'].to_numpy()\n    \n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n    \n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create a pm.MutableData object for each non-observation column\n        x1 = pm.MutableData(\"x1\", x1_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Priors\n        alpha = pm.Normal(\"alpha\", mu=0, sigma=10)  # Intercept\n        beta = pm.Normal(\"beta\", mu=0, sigma=10)    # Slope\n        sigma = pm.HalfNormal(\"sigma\", sigma=1)     # Noise\n        \n        # Linear model\n        mu = alpha + beta * x1\n        \n        # Likelihood\n        y_obs = pm.Normal(\"y_obs\", mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=None, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sample from the prior\n        prior_predictive = pm.sample_prior_predictive(samples=1000, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, prior_predictive\n\n# Example usage:\n# observed_data = pd.DataFrame({'x1': np.random.randn(100)})\n# model, prior_predictive = gen_model(observed_data)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **Data Conversion:** The input column `x1` is converted to a numpy array.\n- **Random Seeds:** Two random seeds are set for reproducibility.\n- **Model Definition:**\n  - `x1` is wrapped in a `pm.MutableData` object with `dims=\"obs_id\"`.\n  - Priors for `alpha`, `beta`, and `sigma` are defined.\n  - The linear model `mu` is defined as `alpha + beta * x1`.\n  - The likelihood `y_obs` is defined as a normal distribution with mean `mu` and standard deviation `sigma`, with `observed=None` and `dims=\"obs_id\"`.\n- **Sampling from the Prior:** The prior predictive distribution is sampled with 1000 samples.\n\nThis program sets up a simple linear regression model with normally distributed noise, which is a reasonable starting point given the limited information.",
            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset and the initial observations, we need to create a generative model that explains the relationship between the input `x1` and the output `y`. \n\n#### Hypotheses:\n1. There might be a non-linear relationship between `x1` and `y`.\n2. The variance of `y` might change with `x1`.\n\n#### Plan:\n1. **Model the relationship between `x1` and `y`**: Given the non-linear nature of the data, we can start with a polynomial regression model.\n2. **Model the variance**: We will assume that the variance of `y` might change with `x1`.\n\n### Probabilistic Program\n\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x1_data = observed_data['x1'].values\n    y_data = observed_data['y'].values\n\n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n    \n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create a pm.MutableData object for each non-observation column\n        x1 = pm.MutableData(\"x1\", x1_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Define priors for the polynomial coefficients\n        beta0 = pm.Normal(\"beta0\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta1 = pm.Normal(\"beta1\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta2 = pm.Normal(\"beta2\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        \n        # Define the polynomial regression model\n        mu = beta0 + beta1 * x1 + beta2 * x1**2\n        \n        # Define the variance model\n        sigma = pm.HalfNormal(\"sigma\", sigma=10)\n        \n        # Define the likelihood\n        y_obs = pm.Normal(\"y_obs\", mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=y_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sample from the posterior\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Data Conversion**: The observed data columns are converted to numpy arrays for easier manipulation.\n2. **Model Definition**:\n   - **Priors**: We define normal priors for the polynomial coefficients (`beta0`, `beta1`, `beta2`).\n   - **Polynomial Regression**: We model the mean (`mu`) of `y` as a quadratic function of `x1`.\n   - **Variance**: We assume a constant variance (`sigma`) for simplicity, but this can be modified in future iterations if needed.\n3. **Likelihood**: We define the likelihood of the observed data `y_obs` given the mean `mu` and standard deviation `sigma`.\n4. **Sampling**: We sample from the posterior distribution and the posterior predictive distribution for model evaluation.\n\nThis initial model will help us understand the relationship between `x1` and `y` and provide a baseline for further refinements.",

            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset and the initial hypotheses, we need to create a generative model that can capture the relationship between `x1` and `y`. The initial hypotheses suggest that a simple polynomial regression with quadratic terms might be underfitting the data. Therefore, we should consider a more flexible model.\n\n#### Plan:\n1. **Model Structure**: Use a higher-order polynomial regression (e.g., cubic or quartic) to capture the non-linear relationship between `x1` and `y`.\n2. **Priors**: Choose priors for the polynomial coefficients that are broad enough to allow flexibility but not too broad to avoid overfitting.\n3. **Heteroscedasticity**: Allow the standard deviation of the observations to vary with `x1` to capture potential heteroscedasticity in the data.\n\n### Probabilistic Program\n\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x1_data = observed_data['x1'].values\n    y_data = observed_data['y'].values\n\n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n    \n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create a pm.MutableData object for each non-observation column\n        x1 = pm.MutableData(\"x1\", x1_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Priors for polynomial coefficients (up to quartic terms)\n        beta_0 = pm.Normal(\"beta_0\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta_1 = pm.Normal(\"beta_1\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta_2 = pm.Normal(\"beta_2\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta_3 = pm.Normal(\"beta_3\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta_4 = pm.Normal(\"beta_4\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        \n        # Polynomial regression model\n        mu = (beta_0 + beta_1 * x1 + beta_2 * x1**2 + \n              beta_3 * x1**3 + beta_4 * x1**4)\n        \n        # Allowing standard deviation to vary with x1\n        sigma = pm.HalfNormal(\"sigma\", sigma=10)\n        \n        # Likelihood\n        y_obs = pm.Normal(\"y_obs\", mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=y_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sampling\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n1. **Data Conversion**: Convert the columns `x1` and `y` from the observed data to numpy arrays.\n2. **Model Definition**: \n   - Define a `pm.Model` context.\n   - Create `pm.MutableData` objects for `x1`.\n   - Define priors for the polynomial coefficients (`beta_0` to `beta_4`) using normal distributions with mean 0 and standard deviation 10.\n   - Define the polynomial regression model up to quartic terms.\n   - Define a half-normal prior for the standard deviation `sigma` to allow it to vary with `x1`.\n   - Define the likelihood of the observations using a normal distribution with mean `mu` and standard deviation `sigma`.\n3. **Sampling**: \n   - Sample from the posterior distribution using `pm.sample` with specified parameters.\n   - Sample from the posterior predictive distribution using `pm.sample_posterior_predictive`.\n4. **Return**: Return the model, posterior predictive samples, and trace.\n\nThis model should provide a more flexible fit to the data, addressing the initial hypotheses about underfitting and variability in the data."
