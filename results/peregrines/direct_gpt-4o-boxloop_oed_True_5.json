            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset of the peregrine population counts over the years, we need to model the population counts (`C`) as a function of the year (`year`). The population counts are likely to be influenced by various factors, including environmental conditions, conservation efforts, and natural population dynamics. \n\nA reasonable starting point is to model the population counts using a Poisson distribution, which is often used for count data. We can assume that the rate parameter (`lambda`) of the Poisson distribution changes over time. To capture this, we can use a linear regression model on the log of the rate parameter (`log(lambda)`) with respect to the year.\n\n### Plan\n1. **Model the rate parameter (`lambda`) of the Poisson distribution**:\n   - Use a linear regression model on the log of `lambda` with respect to the year.\n   - This allows us to capture exponential growth or decay in the population counts over time.\n\n2. **Define priors for the regression coefficients**:\n   - Use normal priors for the intercept and slope of the regression model.\n\n3. **Define the likelihood**:\n   - Use a Poisson distribution for the population counts with the rate parameter `lambda`.\n\n### Probabilistic Program\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    year = observed_data['year'].values\n    C = observed_data['C'].values\n\n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n\n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create a pm.MutableData object for each non-observation column\n        year_data = pm.MutableData(\"year\", year, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Priors for the regression coefficients\n        intercept = pm.Normal(\"intercept\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        slope = pm.Normal(\"slope\", mu=0, sigma=1)\n        \n        # Linear model for the log of the rate parameter\n        log_lambda = intercept + slope * year_data\n        \n        # Rate parameter of the Poisson distribution\n        lambda_ = pm.math.exp(log_lambda)\n        \n        # Likelihood\n        y_obs = pm.Poisson(\"y_obs\", mu=lambda_, observed=C, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sampling\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Priors**: We use normal priors for the intercept and slope of the linear regression model on the log of the rate parameter (`log(lambda)`).\n- **Likelihood**: We use a Poisson distribution for the population counts (`C`) with the rate parameter `lambda`.\n- **MutableData**: We wrap the `year` column in a `pm.MutableData` object to allow for future updates to the data.\n- **Sampling**: We sample from the posterior distribution and the posterior predictive distribution for model evaluation.\n\nThis initial model assumes that the population counts follow a Poisson distribution with a rate parameter that changes exponentially over time.

            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset, we need to model the population counts of Peregrines (`C`) over the years (`year`). The data shows that the population count can vary significantly from year to year. A reasonable starting point is to assume that the population count follows a Poisson distribution, which is often used for count data. The rate parameter (\u03bb) of the Poisson distribution can be modeled as a function of the year.\n\n1. **Modeling the Rate Parameter (\u03bb):**\n   - We can start with a simple linear model where the log of the rate parameter (\u03bb) is a linear function of the year. This allows for exponential growth or decay in the population count.\n   - Mathematically, we can write: \\( \\log(\\lambda) = \\alpha + \\beta \\cdot \\text{year} \\)\n   - This implies: \\( \\lambda = \\exp(\\alpha + \\beta \\cdot \\text{year}) \\)\n\n2. **Likelihood:**\n   - Given the rate parameter \u03bb, the population count `C` can be modeled using a Poisson distribution: \\( C \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda) \\)\n\n3. **Priors:**\n   - We need to set priors for the parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2. Since we don't have strong prior knowledge, we can use weakly informative priors.\n\n### Probabilistic Program\n\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    year = observed_data['year'].values\n    C = observed_data['C'].values\n    \n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n    \n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create a pm.MutableData object for each non-observation column\n        year_data = pm.MutableData(\"year\", year, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Priors for the parameters\n        alpha = pm.Normal(\"alpha\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta = pm.Normal(\"beta\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        \n        # Linear model for the log of the rate parameter\n        log_lambda = alpha + beta * year_data\n        \n        # Rate parameter\n        lambda_ = pm.Deterministic(\"lambda_\", pm.math.exp(log_lambda))\n        \n        # Likelihood\n        y_obs = pm.Poisson(\"y_obs\", mu=lambda_, observed=C, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sampling\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n1. **Data Preparation:**\n   - The observed data columns are converted to numpy arrays for easier manipulation.\n   - The `year` column is wrapped in a `pm.MutableData` object to allow for future updates if needed.\n\n2. **Model Definition:**\n   - Priors for the parameters `alpha` and `beta` are defined using normal distributions with mean 0 and standard deviation 10.\n   - The log of the rate parameter `log_lambda` is modeled as a linear function of the year.\n   - The rate parameter `lambda_` is obtained by exponentiating `log_lambda`.\n   - The population count `C` is modeled using a Poisson distribution with the rate parameter `lambda_`.\n\n3. **Sampling:**\n   - The model is sampled using `pm.sample` with specified parameters for tuning and random seeds for reproducibility.\n   - Posterior predictive samples are drawn using `pm.sample_posterior_predictive`.\n\nThis initial model assumes a simple linear relationship between the log of the rate parameter and the year.
