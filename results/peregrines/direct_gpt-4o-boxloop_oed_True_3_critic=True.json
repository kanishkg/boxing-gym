            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset and the nature of the problem, we need to model the population counts of Peregrines over the years. The population counts are likely to be influenced by various factors, including environmental conditions, predation, and human activities. However, since we only have the year as an input variable, we will use it to model the population counts.\n\n#### Hypotheses:\n1. The population counts might follow a Poisson distribution since they are count data.\n2. The mean of the Poisson distribution could be a function of the year, possibly a linear or polynomial function.\n\n#### Plan:\n1. Convert the observed data columns to numpy arrays.\n2. Create a `pm.MutableData` object for the year.\n3. Define a linear or polynomial function for the mean of the Poisson distribution.\n4. Use a Poisson distribution for the population counts.\n5. Sample from the posterior and posterior predictive distributions.\n\n### Probabilistic Program\n\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    year = observed_data['year'].values\n    C = observed_data['C'].values\n\n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n\n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create a pm.MutableData object for the year\n        year_data = pm.MutableData(\"year\", year, dims=\"obs_id\")\n\n        # Define priors for the coefficients of a linear model\n        intercept = pm.Normal(\"intercept\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        slope = pm.Normal(\"slope\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n\n        # Define the linear model for the mean of the Poisson distribution\n        mu = intercept + slope * year_data\n\n        # Define the Poisson likelihood for the population counts\n        y_obs = pm.Poisson(\"y_obs\", mu=pm.math.exp(mu), observed=C, dims=\"obs_id\")\n\n        # Sample from the posterior\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n\n        # Sample from the posterior predictive distribution\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n\n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n1. **Data Conversion**: The observed data columns are converted to numpy arrays.\n2. **Mutable Data**: A `pm.MutableData` object is created for the year.\n3. **Priors**: Priors for the intercept and slope of a linear model are defined using normal distributions.\n4. **Linear Model**: A linear model is defined for the mean of the Poisson distribution.\n5. **Likelihood**: A Poisson distribution is used for the population counts, with the mean being the exponential of the linear model.\n6. **Sampling**: The posterior and posterior predictive distributions are sampled.\n\nThis model assumes that the population counts follow a Poisson distribution with a mean that is a linear function of the year. The exponential function is used to ensure that the mean is positive. This is a reasonable starting point, and we can refine the model based on the results of the posterior predictive checks.",

            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset and the initial hypotheses, we need to model the population counts of peregrines (`C`) over the years (`year`).
