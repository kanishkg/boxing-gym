At 0.5, the response is 151, and at 1, it is 256.\n2. **Peak**: The function reaches its peak at an input of 1.5, where the response is 336. This is the highest observed value.\n3. **Decrease**: After the peak, the function starts to decrease. At 2, the response is 310, and at 2.5, it drops to 179.\n4. **Further Decrease**: The function continues to decrease as the input increases beyond 2.5. At 3, the response is 51, and it reaches 0 at both 4 and 5.\n\nIn summary, the function increases from 0 to 1.5, reaching its maximum value at 1.5, and then decreases steadily to 0 by the time the input reaches 4. The behavior suggests a peak at 1.5, with a gradual increase before and a more rapid decrease after this point. This pattern should help in predicting the function's response to other inputs within the range of 0 to 5."
