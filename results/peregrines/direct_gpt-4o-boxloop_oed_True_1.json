            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset and the task, we need to model the population counts of Peregrines (`C`) over the years (`year`). The data shows that the population counts can vary significantly, including some years with zero counts. This suggests that the population dynamics might be influenced by various factors, including environmental conditions, predation, and human activities.\n\n#### Hypotheses:\n1. The population count (`C`) is influenced by the year (`year`).\n2. The population count might exhibit some form of trend over the years, possibly due to conservation efforts or environmental changes.\n\n#### Model Plan:\n1. **Data Transformation**: Convert the `year` and `C` columns to numpy arrays.\n2. **Model Specification**:\n   - Use a Poisson distribution for the population counts (`C`) since it is a count data.\n   - Model the rate parameter (`lambda`) of the Poisson distribution as a function of the year. This can be done using a linear regression or a more flexible model like a polynomial regression.\n3. **Priors**:\n   - Use weakly informative priors for the regression coefficients to allow the data to inform the posterior distribution.\n\n### Program\n\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    year = observed_data['year'].values\n    C = observed_data['C'].values\n\n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n\n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create a pm.MutableData object for each non-observation column\n        year_data = pm.MutableData(\"year\", year, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Define priors for the regression coefficients\n        intercept = pm.Normal(\"intercept\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        slope = pm.Normal(\"slope\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        \n        # Define the linear model for the rate parameter (lambda)\n        lambda_ = pm.math.exp(intercept + slope * year_data)\n        \n        # Define the likelihood using a Poisson distribution\n        y_obs = pm.Poisson(\"y_obs\", mu=lambda_, observed=C, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sample from the posterior\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        \n        # Sample from the posterior predictive distribution\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Data Transformation**: The `year` and `C` columns are converted to numpy arrays.\n2. **Model Specification**:\n   - `year_data` is created as a `pm.MutableData` object to allow for future updates.\n   - Priors for the intercept and slope of the linear model are defined using normal distributions with mean 0 and standard deviation 10.\n   - The rate parameter (`lambda_`) of the Poisson distribution is modeled as an exponential function of the linear combination of the intercept and slope times the year.\n   - The likelihood is defined using a Poisson distribution with the observed population counts (`C`).\n3. **Sampling**:\n   - The posterior distribution is sampled using `pm.sample` with specified parameters.\n   - The posterior predictive distribution is sampled using `pm.sample_posterior_predictive`.\n\nThis model should capture the trend in the population counts over the years while allowing for the count nature of the data."
