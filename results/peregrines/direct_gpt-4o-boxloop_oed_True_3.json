            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset and the task, we need to model the population counts of Peregrines (`C`) over the years (`year`). The data suggests that the population count can vary significantly from year to year. A reasonable starting point is to assume that the population count follows a Poisson distribution, which is often used for count data. The rate parameter (\u03bb) of the Poisson distribution can be modeled as a function of the year.\n\n1. **Modeling the Rate Parameter (\u03bb):**\n   - We can start with a simple linear model for the rate parameter: \u03bb = exp(\u03b1 + \u03b2 * year). The exponential function ensures that \u03bb is always positive.\n\n2. **Priors:**\n   - For the intercept (\u03b1) and slope (\u03b2), we can use normal priors.\n\n3. **Likelihood:**\n   - The population count `C` follows a Poisson distribution with the rate parameter \u03bb.\n\n### Program\n\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    year = observed_data['year'].values\n    C = observed_data['C'].values\n\n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create a pm.MutableData object for each non-observation column\n        year_data = pm.MutableData(\"year\", year, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Priors for the intercept and slope\n        alpha = pm.Normal(\"alpha\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta = pm.Normal(\"beta\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        \n        # Linear model for the rate parameter\n        lambda_ = pm.math.exp(alpha + beta * year_data)\n        \n        # Likelihood\n        y_obs = pm.Poisson(\"y_obs\", mu=lambda_, observed=C, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sampling\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=np.random.default_rng(42), idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=np.random.default_rng(314), return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Priors:**\n  - `alpha` and `beta` are given normal priors with mean 0 and standard deviation 10. This is a relatively uninformative prior, allowing the data to drive the inference.\n  \n- **Rate Parameter (\u03bb):**\n  - The rate parameter \u03bb is modeled as an exponential function of a linear combination of `year`. This ensures that \u03bb is always positive.\n\n- **Likelihood:**\n  - The population count `C` is modeled as a Poisson random variable with rate parameter \u03bb.\n\n- **Sampling:**\n  - We sample from the posterior distribution using `pm.sample` and then generate posterior predictive samples using `pm.sample_posterior_predictive`.\n\nThis initial model should provide a good starting point. After fitting this model, we can compare the posterior predictive samples to the actual data and refine the model as needed."
