This pattern suggests a non-linear relationship, where the population rises quickly, reaches a maximum, and then falls off rapidly.\n\nThe statistical model used to analyze the data infers a linear trend with an intercept of approximately 1.087 and a slope of -0.010. This means that, on average, the population decreases over time, but the initial increase and subsequent sharp decline indicate a more complex pattern.\n\nTo predict the population at a specific time, consider the following:\n- The population is highest around time 1.\n- It decreases significantly after time 1, reaching near zero by time 3.\n- The decline continues to zero by time 3.25 and remains zero until time 5.\n\nUsing this understanding, you can estimate the population at any given time within the range.
