            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset and the initial observations, we need to create a generative model that explains the relationship between `x1` (input) and `y` (output). Since we don't have any prior hypotheses or previous models to revise, we'll start with a simple linear regression model. This is a common starting point for modeling relationships between variables.\n\n1. **Model Assumptions**:\n   - The output `y` is linearly dependent on the input `x1`.\n   - There is some noise in the observations of `y`, which we will model using a normal distribution.\n\n2. **Model Components**:\n   - **Intercept (`alpha`)**: The baseline value of `y` when `x1` is zero.\n   - **Slope (`beta`)**: The rate of change of `y` with respect to `x1`.\n   - **Noise (`sigma`)**: The standard deviation of the noise in the observations of `y`.\n\n3. **Probabilistic Model**:\n   - `y = alpha + beta * x1 + epsilon`, where `epsilon` is normally distributed noise with mean 0 and standard deviation `sigma`.\n\n### Probabilistic Program\n\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x1_data = observed_data['x1'].values\n    y_data = observed_data['y'].values\n    \n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n    \n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create a pm.MutableData object for each non-observation column\n        x1 = pm.MutableData(\"x1\", x1_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Define priors for the intercept and slope\n        alpha = pm.Normal(\"alpha\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta = pm.Normal(\"beta\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        \n        # Define prior for the noise\n        sigma = pm.HalfNormal(\"sigma\", sigma=10)\n        \n        # Define the linear model\n        mu = alpha + beta * x1\n        \n        # Define the likelihood of the observations\n        y_obs = pm.Normal(\"y_obs\", mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=y_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sample from the posterior\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        \n        # Sample from the posterior predictive\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **Data Conversion**: The observed data columns are converted to numpy arrays for easier manipulation.\n- **Model Definition**: \n  - `x1` is wrapped in a `pm.MutableData` object to allow for future updates.\n  - Priors for `alpha`, `beta`, and `sigma` are defined using normal and half-normal distributions.\n  - The linear relationship between `x1` and `y` is defined as `mu = alpha + beta * x1`.\n  - The likelihood of the observations `y_obs` is defined as a normal distribution with mean `mu` and standard deviation `sigma`.\n- **Sampling**: \n  - The posterior distribution is sampled using `pm.sample`.\n  - The posterior predictive distribution is sampled using `pm.sample_posterior_predictive`.\n\nThis initial model will help us understand the basic relationship between `x1` and `y`. Based on the results, we can refine the model in subsequent rounds.",

Additionally, the noise in the data might not be normally distributed, and the priors for the parameters should be more informative.\n\n**Hypotheses to Address:**\n1. The linear relationship assumed between `x1` and `y` might not be appropriate.\n2. The noise in the data might not be normally distributed.\n3. The priors for the intercept (`alpha`) and slope (`beta`) might be too vague.\n\n**Plan:**\n1. Use a polynomial regression model to capture potential non-linear relationships.\n2. Consider using a Student's t-distribution for the noise to handle potential outliers.\n3. Use more informative priors for the model parameters.\n\n### Probabilistic Program\n\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x1_data = observed_data['x1'].to_numpy()\n    y_data = observed_data['y'].to_numpy()\n    \n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n    \n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create a pm.MutableData object for each non-observation column\n        x1 = pm.MutableData(\"x1\", x1_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Priors for polynomial regression coefficients\n        alpha = pm.Normal(\"alpha\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta1 = pm.Normal(\"beta1\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta2 = pm.Normal(\"beta2\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        \n        # Polynomial regression model\n        mu = alpha + beta1 * x1 + beta2 * x1**2\n        \n        # Student's t-distribution for the noise\n        sigma = pm.HalfNormal(\"sigma\", sigma=10)\n        nu = pm.Exponential(\"nu\", 1/30)\n        \n        # Likelihood of the observations\n        y_obs = pm.StudentT(\"y_obs\", mu=mu, sigma=sigma, nu=nu, observed=y_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sampling\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n1. **Data Conversion**: Convert the columns `x1` and `y` from the observed data to numpy arrays.\n2. **Model Definition**: \n   - Define the model using `pm.Model()`.\n   - Create `pm.MutableData` objects for `x1`.\n   - Define priors for the polynomial regression coefficients (`alpha`, `beta1`, `beta2`).\n   - Define the polynomial regression model (`mu`).\n   - Use a Student's t-distribution for the noise with parameters `sigma` and `nu`.\n   - Define the likelihood of the observations (`y_obs`).\n3. **Sampling**: \n   - Sample from the posterior distribution using `pm.sample()`.\n   - Sample from the posterior predictive distribution using `pm.sample_posterior_predictive()`.\n4. **Return**: Return the model, posterior predictive samples, and trace.\n\nThis model should better capture the non-linear relationship between `x1` and `y` and handle potential outliers in the data.",
            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset and the initial round, we need to start with a relatively simple model. Since we have no prior information about the relationship between `x1` and `y`, we can start with a linear regression model. This will allow us to capture any linear trends in the data. If the linear model does not fit well, we can consider more complex models in subsequent rounds.\n\n#### Hypotheses:\n1. The relationship between `x1` and `y` might be linear.\n2. The noise in the data can be modeled using a normal distribution.\n\n#### Plan:\n1. Use a linear regression model to capture the relationship between `x1` and `y`.\n2. Use normal distribution for the noise.\n3. Use informative priors for the coefficients to avoid overfitting.\n\n### Probabilistic Program\n\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x1_data = observed_data['x1'].values\n    y_data = observed_data['y'].values\n    \n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n    \n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create a pm.MutableData object for each non-observation column\n        x1 = pm.MutableData(\"x1\", x1_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Define priors for the coefficients\n        intercept = pm.Normal(\"intercept\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        slope = pm.Normal(\"slope\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        \n        # Define the linear model\n        mu = intercept + slope * x1\n        \n        # Define the likelihood\n        sigma = pm.HalfNormal(\"sigma\", sigma=10)\n        y_obs = pm.Normal(\"y_obs\", mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=y_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sample from the posterior\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        \n        # Sample from the posterior predictive\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n1. **Data Conversion**: Convert the columns `x1` and `y` from the observed data to numpy arrays.\n2. **Model Definition**: \n   - Define a linear regression model with `x1` as the input and `y` as the output.\n   - Use normal priors for the intercept and slope with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 10.\n   - Define the likelihood using a normal distribution with a half-normal prior for the standard deviation.\n3. **Sampling**: \n   - Sample from the posterior using `pm.sample` with specified parameters for reproducibility.\n   - Sample from the posterior predictive to generate predictions.\n\nThis initial model will help us understand the basic relationship between `x1` and `y`.
