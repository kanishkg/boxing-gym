            "Let's start by sketching a high-level probabilistic program for the data. Since we only have one input column `x1` and one output column `y`, we can assume a simple linear relationship between `x1` and `y` for our initial model. \n\n### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n1. **Model Assumptions:**\n   - `x1` is the input feature.\n   - `y` is the output feature.\n   - We assume a linear relationship between `x1` and `y` with some Gaussian noise.\n\n2. **Model Components:**\n   - **Priors:**\n     - Intercept (`alpha`): Normally distributed.\n     - Slope (`beta`): Normally distributed.\n     - Noise (`sigma`): Half-normal distribution to ensure positivity.\n   - **Likelihood:**\n     - `y` is normally distributed with mean `mu = alpha + beta * x1` and standard deviation `sigma`.\n\n### Probabilistic Program\nNow, let's write the program in PyMC:\n\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x1_data = np.array(observed_data['x1'])\n    \n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n    \n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create a pm.MutableData object for each non-observation column\n        x1 = pm.MutableData(\"x1\", x1_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Priors\n        alpha = pm.Normal(\"alpha\", mu=0, sigma=10)  # Intercept\n        beta = pm.Normal(\"beta\", mu=0, sigma=10)    # Slope\n        sigma = pm.HalfNormal(\"sigma\", sigma=1)     # Noise\n        \n        # Linear model\n        mu = alpha + beta * x1\n        \n        # Likelihood\n        y_obs = pm.Normal(\"y_obs\", mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=None, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sample from the prior\n        prior_predictive = pm.sample_prior_predictive(samples=1000, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, prior_predictive\n\n# Example usage:\n# observed_data = {'x1': np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])}\n# model, prior_predictive = gen_model(observed_data)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n- **Data Conversion:** The input data `x1` is converted to a numpy array.\n- **Random Seeds:** Two random seeds are set for reproducibility.\n- **Model Definition:**\n  - `x1` is wrapped in a `pm.MutableData` container with `dims=\"obs_id\"`.\n  - Priors for `alpha`, `beta`, and `sigma` are defined.\n  - The linear relationship `mu = alpha + beta * x1` is specified.\n  - The likelihood of `y_obs` is defined as a normal distribution with mean `mu` and standard deviation `sigma`, with `observed=None` and `dims=\"obs_id\"`.\n- **Sampling:** The prior predictive distribution is sampled with 1000 samples.\n\nThis program sets up a simple linear regression model with Gaussian noise, which is a reasonable starting point given the limited information.",
            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset and the initial rows provided, we need to create a generative model that explains the relationship between `x1` (input) and `y` (output). Since we don't have any prior hypotheses or synthesis, we will start with a simple linear regression model. This is a classic model that often works well for such datasets.\n\n**Hypotheses:**\n1. The output `y` is linearly dependent on the input `x1`.\n2. There is some noise in the observations of `y`.\n\n### Plan\n1. Define a linear relationship between `x1` and `y`.\n2. Introduce a noise term to account for the variability in `y`.\n3. Use PyMC to define the probabilistic model and sample from the posterior.\n\n### Probabilistic Program\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x1_data = observed_data['x1'].values\n    y_data = observed_data['y'].values\n    \n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n    \n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create a pm.MutableData object for each non-observation column\n        x1 = pm.MutableData(\"x1\", x1_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Define priors for the linear model parameters\n        intercept = pm.Normal(\"intercept\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        slope = pm.Normal(\"slope\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        sigma = pm.HalfNormal(\"sigma\", sigma=10)\n        \n        # Define the linear model\n        mu = intercept + slope * x1\n        \n        # Define the likelihood of the observations\n        y_obs = pm.Normal(\"y_obs\", mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=y_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sample from the posterior\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Data Conversion**: The observed data columns are converted to numpy arrays for easier manipulation.\n2. **Model Definition**: \n   - `x1` is defined as a `pm.MutableData` object.\n   - Priors for the intercept, slope, and noise (`sigma`) are defined using normal and half-normal distributions.\n   - The linear relationship is defined as `mu = intercept + slope * x1`.\n   - The likelihood of the observations is defined using a normal distribution with mean `mu` and standard deviation `sigma`.\n3. **Sampling**: The model samples from the posterior distribution and generates posterior predictive samples.\n\nThis initial model assumes a simple linear relationship between `x1` and `y`. In subsequent rounds, we can refine this model based on the discrepancies between the actual data and the sampled data.",
