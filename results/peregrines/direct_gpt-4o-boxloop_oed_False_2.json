            "Let's start by sketching a high-level probabilistic program for the data. Since we only have one input feature `x1` and one output `y`, we can assume a simple linear relationship between `x1` and `y` with some noise. \n\n### High-Level Probabilistic Program\n1. **Model Assumptions**:\n   - `y` is linearly dependent on `x1` with some noise.\n   - The noise is normally distributed with a mean of 0 and some standard deviation `sigma`.\n\n2. **Model Components**:\n   - **Priors**:\n     - Intercept (`alpha`): Normally distributed with mean 0 and a large standard deviation (e.g., 10).\n     - Slope (`beta`): Normally distributed with mean 0 and a large standard deviation (e.g., 10).\n     - Noise (`sigma`): Half-normal distribution to ensure it's positive.\n   - **Likelihood**:\n     - `y` is normally distributed with mean `mu = alpha + beta * x1` and standard deviation `sigma`.\n\n### Probabilistic Program\nNow, let's write the probabilistic program in PyMC:\n\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x1_data = observed_data['x1'].to_numpy()\n    \n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n    \n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create a pm.MutableData object for each non-observation column\n        x1 = pm.MutableData(\"x1\", x1_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Priors\n        alpha = pm.Normal(\"alpha\", mu=0, sigma=10)  # Intercept\n        beta = pm.Normal(\"beta\", mu=0, sigma=10)    # Slope\n        sigma = pm.HalfNormal(\"sigma\", sigma=1)     # Noise standard deviation\n        \n        # Linear model\n        mu = alpha + beta * x1\n        \n        # Likelihood\n        y_obs = pm.Normal(\"y_obs\", mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=None, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sample from the prior\n        prior_predictive = pm.sample_prior_predictive(samples=1000, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, prior_predictive\n\n# Example usage:\n# observed_data = pd.DataFrame({'x1': np.random.randn(100)})\n# model, prior_predictive = gen_model(observed_data)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n- **Data Conversion**: The input feature `x1` is converted to a numpy array.\n- **Model Definition**: \n  - `x1` is wrapped in a `pm.MutableData` container with `dims=\"obs_id\"`.\n  - Priors for `alpha`, `beta`, and `sigma` are defined.\n  - The linear relationship `mu = alpha + beta * x1` is specified.\n  - The likelihood of `y_obs` is defined as a normal distribution with mean `mu` and standard deviation `sigma`, with `observed=None` to indicate that we are not using actual observations.\n- **Sampling**: We sample from the prior predictive distribution to generate prior samples.\n\nThis program sets up a simple linear regression model with normally distributed noise and samples from the prior distribution.",
            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset and the initial rows provided, we need to model the relationship between `x1` (input) and `y` (output). The data suggests a non-linear relationship, possibly with some noise. \n\n#### Hypotheses:\n1. There is a non-linear relationship between `x1` and `y`.\n2. The noise in the data can be modeled using a normal distribution.\n\n#### Plan:\n1. Use a polynomial regression model to capture the non-linear relationship.\n2. Model the noise using a normal distribution with a standard deviation parameter `sigma`.\n\n### Probabilistic Program\n\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x1_data = observed_data['x1'].values\n    y_data = observed_data['y'].values\n    \n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n    \n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create a pm.MutableData object for each non-observation column\n        x1 = pm.MutableData(\"x1\", x1_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Define priors for the polynomial coefficients\n        intercept = pm.Normal(\"intercept\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta1 = pm.Normal(\"beta1\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta2 = pm.Normal(\"beta2\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        \n        # Define the polynomial regression model\n        mu = intercept + beta1 * x1 + beta2 * x1**2\n        \n        # Define the likelihood\n        sigma = pm.HalfNormal(\"sigma\", sigma=10)\n        y_obs = pm.Normal(\"y_obs\", mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=y_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sample from the posterior\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        \n        # Sample from the posterior predictive\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n1. **Data Conversion**: Convert the columns `x1` and `y` from the observed data to numpy arrays.\n2. **Model Definition**: \n   - Define a polynomial regression model with an intercept and two coefficients (`beta1` and `beta2`) for the linear and quadratic terms.\n   - Use `pm.MutableData` to wrap the `x1` data.\n   - Define priors for the intercept and coefficients using normal distributions.\n   - Define the polynomial relationship `mu`.\n   - Define the likelihood of the observations `y_obs` using a normal distribution with mean `mu` and standard deviation `sigma`.\n3. **Sampling**: \n   - Sample from the posterior distribution using `pm.sample`.\n   - Sample from the posterior predictive distribution using `pm.sample_posterior_predictive`.\n\nThis initial model captures the potential non-linear relationship between `x1` and `y` and accounts for noise in the data. We will refine this model based on the summary statistics and discrepancies observed in subsequent rounds.",
            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset and the initial observations, we need to create a generative model that explains the relationship between the input `x1` and the output `y`. \n\n1. **Model Choice**: \n   - Since `y` appears to be a count or discrete variable, a Poisson or Negative Binomial distribution might be appropriate.\n   - The relationship between `x1` and `y` could be non-linear given the wide range of `y` values for small changes in `x1`. We might consider a polynomial or exponential relationship.\n\n2. **Initial Hypotheses**:\n   - `y` is generated from a Poisson distribution with a rate parameter `lambda` that is a function of `x1`.\n   - The rate parameter `lambda` could be modeled as an exponential function of `x1` to capture potential non-linearities.\n\n### Probabilistic Program\n\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x1_data = observed_data['x1'].values\n    y_data = observed_data['y'].values\n    \n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n    \n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create a pm.MutableData object for each non-observation column\n        x1 = pm.MutableData(\"x1\", x1_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Define priors for the parameters of the model\n        alpha = pm.Normal(\"alpha\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta = pm.Normal(\"beta\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        \n        # Define the rate parameter lambda as an exponential function of x1\n        lambda_ = pm.math.exp(alpha + beta * x1)\n        \n        # Define the likelihood of the observations\n        y_obs = pm.Poisson(\"y_obs\", mu=lambda_, observed=y_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sample from the posterior\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        \n        # Sample from the posterior predictive\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n\n# Example usage:\n# observed_data = pd.DataFrame({\n#     'x1': [0.00, 5.00, 2.50, 1.00, 1.50, 2.00, 0.50, 1.25, 1.75, 3.00],\n#     'y': [62, 0, 61, 207, 222, 155, 121, 204, 206, 6]\n# })\n# model, posterior_predictive, trace = gen_model(observed_data)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n1. **Data Preparation**:\n   - Convert the columns `x1` and `y` from the observed data to numpy arrays for easier manipulation.\n\n2. **Model Definition**:\n   - Use `pm.Model()` to define the probabilistic model.\n   - Create `pm.MutableData` objects for the input feature `x1`.\n   - Define priors for the parameters `alpha` and `beta` using normal distributions.\n   - Model the rate parameter `lambda` as an exponential function of `x1` to capture potential non-linear relationships.\n   - Define the likelihood of the observations `y_obs` using a Poisson distribution with the rate parameter `lambda`.\n\n3. **Sampling**:\n   - Use `pm.sample()` to draw samples from the posterior distribution.\n   - Use `pm.sample_posterior_predictive()` to draw samples from the posterior predictive distribution.\n\n4. **Return**:\n   - Return the model, posterior predictive samples, and trace for further analysis.\n\nThis initial model assumes a Poisson distribution for `y` and an exponential relationship between `x1` and the rate parameter `lambda`.
