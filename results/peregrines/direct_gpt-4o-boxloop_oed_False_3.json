            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset and the initial observations, we need to create a generative model that can explain the relationship between `x1` (input) and `y` (output). The data shows a non-linear relationship between `x1` and `y`, with `y` having a high value at `x1 = 0` and `x1 = 1.25`, and dropping to zero at `x1 = 5` and `x1 = 3.75`. This suggests that a simple linear model might not be sufficient.\n\n#### Hypotheses:\n1. The relationship between `x1` and `y` is non-linear.\n2. There might be a quadratic or higher-order polynomial relationship between `x1` and `y`.\n3. The variance of `y` might change with `x1`.\n\n#### Plan:\n1. Use a polynomial regression model to capture the non-linear relationship.\n2. Use a normal distribution for the likelihood of `y` with a mean that is a polynomial function of `x1`.\n3. Allow the variance of `y` to be a parameter to capture potential heteroscedasticity.\n\n### Probabilistic Program\n\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x1_data = observed_data['x1'].values\n    y_data = observed_data['y'].values\n\n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n\n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create a pm.MutableData object for each non-observation column\n        x1 = pm.MutableData(\"x1\", x1_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Define priors for the polynomial coefficients\n        beta0 = pm.Normal(\"beta0\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta1 = pm.Normal(\"beta1\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta2 = pm.Normal(\"beta2\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        \n        # Define the polynomial mean function\n        mu = beta0 + beta1 * x1 + beta2 * x1**2\n        \n        # Define the likelihood\n        sigma = pm.HalfNormal(\"sigma\", sigma=10)\n        y_obs = pm.Normal(\"y_obs\", mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=y_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sample from the posterior\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Data Conversion**: The observed data columns are converted to numpy arrays for easier manipulation.\n2. **Model Definition**: \n   - `x1` is defined as a `pm.MutableData` object to allow for future updates.\n   - Priors for the polynomial coefficients (`beta0`, `beta1`, `beta2`) are defined as normal distributions with mean 0 and standard deviation 10.\n   - The mean function `mu` is defined as a quadratic polynomial of `x1`.\n   - The likelihood of `y` is defined as a normal distribution with mean `mu` and standard deviation `sigma`, where `sigma` is a half-normal distribution to ensure positivity.\n3. **Sampling**: The model samples from the posterior distribution and generates posterior predictive samples for model evaluation.\n\nThis initial model captures the potential non-linear relationship between `x1` and `y` using a quadratic polynomial. Further iterations will refine the model based on the discrepancies between the actual data and the sampled data.",
            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset and the observed relationship between `x1` and `y`, it appears that `y` might have a non-linear relationship with `x1`. The values of `y` seem to vary significantly, suggesting that a simple linear model might not be sufficient. Instead, we might consider a model that can capture more complex relationships, such as a polynomial regression or a model with interaction terms.\n\n#### Hypotheses:\n1. The relationship between `x1` and `y` is non-linear.\n2. There might be a polynomial relationship between `x1` and `y`.\n\n### Plan:\n1. Use a polynomial regression model to capture the non-linear relationship between `x1` and `y`.\n2. Use a Normal distribution for the likelihood of `y` with a mean (`mu`) that is a polynomial function of `x1`.\n3. Use appropriate priors for the polynomial coefficients and the standard deviation (`sigma`).\n\n### Probabilistic Program\n\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x1_data = observed_data['x1'].values\n    y_data = observed_data['y'].values\n    \n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n    \n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create a pm.MutableData object for each non-observation column\n        x1 = pm.MutableData(\"x1\", x1_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Priors for polynomial coefficients\n        beta0 = pm.Normal(\"beta0\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta1 = pm.Normal(\"beta1\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta2 = pm.Normal(\"beta2\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        \n        # Polynomial regression model\n        mu = beta0 + beta1 * x1 + beta2 * x1**2\n        \n        # Prior for the standard deviation\n        sigma = pm.HalfNormal(\"sigma\", sigma=10)\n        \n        # Likelihood of the observations\n        y_obs = pm.Normal(\"y_obs\", mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=y_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sampling\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Data Conversion**: Convert the columns `x1` and `y` from the observed data to numpy arrays.\n2. **Model Definition**: Define a probabilistic model using `pm.Model()`.\n3. **Mutable Data**: Create a `pm.MutableData` object for `x1` to allow for future updates.\n4. **Priors**: Define normal priors for the polynomial coefficients (`beta0`, `beta1`, `beta2`) and a half-normal prior for the standard deviation (`sigma`).\n5. **Polynomial Regression**: Define the mean (`mu`) of the normal distribution as a polynomial function of `x1`.\n6. **Likelihood**: Define the likelihood of the observations (`y_obs`) using a normal distribution with mean `mu` and standard deviation `sigma`.\n7. **Sampling**: Sample from the posterior distribution and the posterior predictive distribution, ensuring reproducibility with random seeds.\n\nThis model should capture the non-linear relationship between `x1` and `y` and provide a good starting point for further refinement based on the observed data and the summary statistics of the samples."
