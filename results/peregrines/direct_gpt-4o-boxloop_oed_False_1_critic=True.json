            "Let's start by sketching a high-level probabilistic program for the data. Since we only have one input feature `x1` and one output `y`, we can assume a simple linear relationship between `x1` and `y` for our initial model. \n\n### High-Level Probabilistic Program\n1. **Model Assumptions**:\n   - `y` is linearly dependent on `x1` with some noise.\n   - The noise is normally distributed.\n\n2. **Model Components**:\n   - **Priors**:\n     - Intercept (`alpha`): Normally distributed.\n     - Slope (`beta`): Normally distributed.\n     - Noise (`sigma`): Half-normal distribution to ensure positivity.\n   - **Likelihood**:\n     - `y` is normally distributed with mean `mu = alpha + beta * x1` and standard deviation `sigma`.\n\n### Plan\n1. Convert the observed data columns to numpy arrays.\n2. Create a `pm.MutableData` object for `x1`.\n3. Define priors for `alpha`, `beta`, and `sigma`.\n4. Define the linear relationship for `mu`.\n5. Define the likelihood for `y` using `mu` and `sigma`.\n6. Sample from the prior predictive distribution.\n\n### Implementation\n\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x1_data = np.array(observed_data['x1'])\n    \n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n    \n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create a pm.MutableData object for x1\n        x1 = pm.MutableData(\"x1\", x1_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Define priors\n        alpha = pm.Normal(\"alpha\", mu=0, sigma=10)  # Prior for intercept\n        beta = pm.Normal(\"beta\", mu=0, sigma=10)    # Prior for slope\n        sigma = pm.HalfNormal(\"sigma\", sigma=1)     # Prior for noise\n        \n        # Define the linear relationship\n        mu = alpha + beta * x1\n        \n        # Define the likelihood\n        y_obs = pm.Normal(\"y_obs\", mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=None, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sample from the prior predictive distribution\n        prior_predictive = pm.sample_prior_predictive(samples=1000, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, prior_predictive\n\n# Note: This function does not perform inference but just samples from the prior.\n```\n\nThis code defines a simple linear regression model with a normal likelihood for the output `y`. The priors for the intercept (`alpha`), slope (`beta`), and noise (`sigma`) are specified, and the likelihood is defined using these parameters. The function then samples from the prior predictive distribution to generate possible values of `y` based on the priors.",
            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset and the lack of prior hypotheses, we will start with a simple linear regression model. This model assumes that the output \\( y \\) is a linear function of the input \\( x1 \\) with some Gaussian noise. This is a reasonable starting point for many types of data and can be extended if necessary.\n\n1. **Model Assumptions:**\n   - \\( y \\) is normally distributed around a mean that is a linear function of \\( x1 \\).\n   - The variance of \\( y \\) is constant (homoscedasticity).\n\n2. **Model Components:**\n   - **Intercept (\\(\\alpha\\))**: The baseline value of \\( y \\) when \\( x1 \\) is zero.\n   - **Slope (\\(\\beta\\))**: The change in \\( y \\) for a one-unit change in \\( x1 \\).\n   - **Noise (\\(\\sigma\\))**: The standard deviation of the noise around the linear relationship.\n\n### Probabilistic Program\n\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x1_data = observed_data['x1'].values\n    y_data = observed_data['y'].values\n    \n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n    \n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create a pm.MutableData object for each non-observation column\n        x1 = pm.MutableData(\"x1\", x1_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Priors for the intercept and slope\n        alpha = pm.Normal(\"alpha\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta = pm.Normal(\"beta\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        \n        # Prior for the noise\n        sigma = pm.HalfNormal(\"sigma\", sigma=10)\n        \n        # Linear model\n        mu = alpha + beta * x1\n        \n        # Likelihood\n        y_obs = pm.Normal(\"y_obs\", mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=y_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sampling\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **Data Conversion**: The observed data columns are converted to numpy arrays for easier manipulation.\n- **Model Definition**: \n  - `x1` is wrapped in a `pm.MutableData` container to allow for future updates.\n  - Priors for the intercept (`alpha`), slope (`beta`), and noise (`sigma`) are defined. These are standard choices for a linear regression model.\n  - The linear relationship between `x1` and `y` is defined as `mu = alpha + beta * x1`.\n  - The likelihood of the observed data `y_obs` is defined as a normal distribution centered around `mu` with standard deviation `sigma`.\n- **Sampling**: The model is sampled using `pm.sample` with specified parameters for reproducibility and efficiency. The posterior predictive distribution is also sampled to generate predictions.\n\nThis initial model will serve as a baseline. Based on the discrepancies between the actual data and the sampled data, we can refine the model in subsequent rounds.",
            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset and the initial hypotheses, we need to create a generative model that captures the relationship between \\( x1 \\) and \\( y \\). The initial hypotheses suggest that a simple linear model might not be sufficient, and we should consider more complex relationships or transformations.\n\n#### Plan:\n1. **Model Structure**: Start with a simple linear model but be open to non-linear transformations if the initial model does not fit well.\n2. **Priors**: Use informative priors based on domain knowledge or reasonable assumptions.\n3. **Noise Assumption**: Start with a homoscedastic noise model but be open to heteroscedastic models if needed.\n4. **Data Transformation**: Consider transformations of \\( x1 \\) or \\( y \\) if the initial model does not fit well.\n\n### Initial Model Proposal\n\nLet's start with a simple linear regression model with normally distributed noise. We will use informative priors for the intercept (\\(\\alpha\\)) and slope (\\(\\beta\\)).\n\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x1_data = observed_data['x1'].values\n    y_data = observed_data['y'].values\n\n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n\n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create a pm.MutableData object for each non-observation column\n        x1 = pm.MutableData(\"x1\", x1_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Priors for the intercept and slope\n        alpha = pm.Normal(\"alpha\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta = pm.Normal(\"beta\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        \n        # Linear model\n        mu = alpha + beta * x1\n        \n        # Noise model\n        sigma = pm.HalfNormal(\"sigma\", sigma=10)\n        \n        # Likelihood\n        y_obs = pm.Normal(\"y_obs\", mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=y_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sampling\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n1. **Data Conversion**: Convert the columns of the observed data to numpy arrays.\n2. **Model Definition**: Define a simple linear regression model with normally distributed noise.\n3. **Priors**: Use normal priors for the intercept and slope with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 10.\n4. **Likelihood**: Define the likelihood of the observations using a normal distribution.\n5. **Sampling**: Sample from the posterior distribution and the posterior predictive distribution.\n\nThis initial model will serve as a baseline. Based on the results, we can revise the model to address any discrepancies between the actual data and the sampled data.",
            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the data and the hypotheses, we need to address the following:\n1. The linear relationship between \\( x1 \\) and \\( y \\) might not be appropriate.\n2. The noise model (sigma) might be too simplistic.\n\nTo address these, we can:\n1. Use a polynomial regression model to capture potential non-linear relationships.\n2. Consider a more flexible noise model, such as a Student's t-distribution, which can handle heavier tails and outliers better than a normal distribution.\n\n### Plan\n1. Use a polynomial regression model of degree 2 (quadratic) to capture potential non-linear relationships.\n2. Use a Student's t-distribution for the noise model to handle the high variance and extreme values in the data.\n\n### Probabilistic Program\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x1_data = observed_data['x1'].values\n    y_data = observed_data['y'].values\n\n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n\n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create a pm.MutableData object for each non-observation column\n        x1 = pm.MutableData(\"x1\", x1_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Priors for polynomial regression coefficients\n        beta0 = pm.Normal(\"beta0\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta1 = pm.Normal(\"beta1\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta2 = pm.Normal(\"beta2\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        \n        # Polynomial regression model\n        mu = beta0 + beta1 * x1 + beta2 * x1**2\n        \n        # Student's t-distribution for noise\n        sigma = pm.HalfNormal(\"sigma\", sigma=10)\n        nu = pm.Exponential(\"nu\", 1/30)\n        \n        # Likelihood\n        y_obs = pm.StudentT(\"y_obs\", mu=mu, sigma=sigma, nu=nu, observed=y_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sampling\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Polynomial Regression Model**: We use a quadratic model \\( \\mu = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x1 + \\beta_2 x1^2 \\) to capture potential non-linear relationships.\n- **Student's t-Distribution**: We use a Student's t-distribution for the noise model to handle the high variance and extreme values in the data.\n- **Priors**: We set normal priors for the polynomial coefficients and a half-normal prior for the scale parameter \\( \\sigma \\). The degrees of freedom \\( \\nu \\) for the Student's t-distribution is given an exponential prior.\n\nThis model should better capture the variability and potential non-linear relationship in the data."
