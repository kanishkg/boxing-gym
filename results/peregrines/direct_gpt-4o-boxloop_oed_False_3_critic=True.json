            "Let's start by sketching a high-level probabilistic program for the data. Since we only have one input feature `x1` and one output `y`, we can assume a simple linear relationship between `x1` and `y` for our initial model. \n\n### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n1. **Model Assumptions**:\n   - `y` is linearly dependent on `x1`.\n   - There is some noise in the observations of `y`.\n\n2. **Model Components**:\n   - **Priors**:\n     - Intercept (`alpha`): Normally distributed.\n     - Slope (`beta`): Normally distributed.\n     - Noise (`sigma`): Half-normal distribution to ensure non-negativity.\n   - **Likelihood**:\n     - `y_obs` is normally distributed with mean `mu = alpha + beta * x1` and standard deviation `sigma`.\n\n### Probabilistic Program\nNow, let's write the program based on the above sketch. \n\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x1_data = observed_data['x1'].to_numpy()\n    \n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n    \n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create a pm.MutableData object for each non-observation column\n        x1 = pm.MutableData(\"x1\", x1_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Priors\n        alpha = pm.Normal(\"alpha\", mu=0, sigma=10)  # Intercept\n        beta = pm.Normal(\"beta\", mu=0, sigma=10)    # Slope\n        sigma = pm.HalfNormal(\"sigma\", sigma=1)     # Noise\n        \n        # Linear model\n        mu = alpha + beta * x1\n        \n        # Likelihood\n        y_obs = pm.Normal(\"y_obs\", mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=None, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sample from the prior\n        prior_predictive = pm.sample_prior_predictive(samples=1000, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, prior_predictive\n\n# Example usage:\n# observed_data = pd.DataFrame({'x1': np.random.randn(100)})\n# model, prior_predictive = gen_model(observed_data)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n- **Data Conversion**: The input feature `x1` is converted to a numpy array.\n- **Model Definition**: \n  - `x1` is wrapped in a `pm.MutableData` container with `dims=\"obs_id\"`.\n  - Priors for `alpha`, `beta`, and `sigma` are defined.\n  - The linear relationship `mu = alpha + beta * x1` is specified.\n  - The likelihood of the observations `y_obs` is defined with `observed=None` and `dims=\"obs_id\"`.\n- **Sampling from the Prior**: We sample from the prior distribution to generate prior predictive samples.\n\nThis program sets up a simple linear regression model with normally distributed priors and a half-normal prior for the noise. The likelihood is defined as a normal distribution with the mean given by the linear model and the standard deviation given by `sigma`.",
            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset, we need to model the relationship between `x1` (input) and `y` (output). The data points suggest a non-linear relationship, possibly with some noise. A reasonable starting point could be a polynomial regression model, where `y` is modeled as a polynomial function of `x1` plus some Gaussian noise.\n\n#### Hypotheses:\n1. The relationship between `x1` and `y` is non-linear.\n2. The noise in the observations can be modeled with a Gaussian distribution.\n\n### Plan:\n1. **Model the relationship between `x1` and `y` using a polynomial regression.**\n2. **Assume Gaussian noise in the observations.**\n\n### Probabilistic Program:\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x1_data = observed_data['x1'].to_numpy()\n    y_data = observed_data['y'].to_numpy()\n    \n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n    \n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create a pm.MutableData object for each non-observation column\n        x1 = pm.MutableData(\"x1\", x1_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Define priors for polynomial coefficients\n        intercept = pm.Normal(\"intercept\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta1 = pm.Normal(\"beta1\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta2 = pm.Normal(\"beta2\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        \n        # Polynomial regression model\n        mu = intercept + beta1 * x1 + beta2 * x1**2\n        \n        # Define the likelihood with Gaussian noise\n        sigma = pm.HalfNormal(\"sigma\", sigma=10)\n        y_obs = pm.Normal(\"y_obs\", mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=y_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sample from the posterior\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        \n        # Sample from the posterior predictive\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Data Conversion**: Convert the columns `x1` and `y` from the observed data to numpy arrays.\n2. **Model Definition**:\n   - **Mutable Data**: Create a `pm.MutableData` object for `x1`.\n   - **Priors**: Define normal priors for the polynomial coefficients (`intercept`, `beta1`, `beta2`).\n   - **Polynomial Regression**: Model `mu` as a polynomial function of `x1`.\n   - **Likelihood**: Define the likelihood of the observations `y_obs` as a normal distribution with mean `mu` and standard deviation `sigma`.\n3. **Sampling**: Use `pm.sample` to draw samples from the posterior and `pm.sample_posterior_predictive` to draw samples from the posterior predictive distribution.\n\nThis initial model assumes a quadratic relationship between `x1` and `y`. We will revise the model based on the discrepancies between the actual data and the sampled data in subsequent rounds.",
            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset and the initial observations, we need to model the relationship between `x1` and `y`. The data points suggest a non-linear relationship, and the values of `y` vary significantly for different values of `x1`. \n\n#### Hypotheses:\n1. The relationship between `x1` and `y` might be non-linear.\n2. The variance of `y` might change with `x1` (heteroscedasticity).\n\n#### Plan:\n1. Use a polynomial regression model to capture the non-linear relationship.\n2. Allow the noise term (`sigma`) to vary with `x1` to account for heteroscedasticity.\n\n### Probabilistic Program\n\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x1_data = observed_data['x1'].values\n    y_data = observed_data['y'].values\n\n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n\n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create a pm.MutableData object for each non-observation column\n        x1 = pm.MutableData(\"x1\", x1_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Define priors for the polynomial coefficients\n        beta0 = pm.Normal(\"beta0\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta1 = pm.Normal(\"beta1\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta2 = pm.Normal(\"beta2\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        \n        # Define the polynomial regression model\n        mu = beta0 + beta1 * x1 + beta2 * x1**2\n        \n        # Allow the noise term to vary with x1\n        sigma = pm.HalfNormal(\"sigma\", sigma=10)\n        \n        # Define the likelihood\n        y_obs = pm.Normal(\"y_obs\", mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=y_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sample from the posterior\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        \n        # Sample from the posterior predictive\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Data Conversion**: Convert the columns `x1` and `y` from the observed data to numpy arrays.\n2. **Model Definition**: \n   - Define a polynomial regression model with coefficients `beta0`, `beta1`, and `beta2`.\n   - Allow the noise term (`sigma`) to vary with `x1` by using a `HalfNormal` distribution.\n3. **Likelihood**: Define the likelihood of the observations using a normal distribution with mean `mu` and standard deviation `sigma`.\n4. **Sampling**: Sample from the posterior distribution and the posterior predictive distribution.\n\nThis model should capture the non-linear relationship between `x1` and `y` and account for potential heteroscedasticity in the data.",
            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset and the initial hypotheses, we need to create a generative model that can capture the relationship between `x1` and `y`. The initial hypotheses suggest that a simple polynomial regression might be underfitting the data and that the noise term might not be adequately capturing the variability.\n\n#### Plan:\n1. **Model Structure**:\n   - Use a higher-degree polynomial regression (e.g., third-degree) to capture more complex relationships.\n   - Allow the noise term to vary with `x1` to account for heteroscedasticity.\n\n2. **Priors**:\n   - Use informative priors for the polynomial coefficients to guide the model based on domain knowledge.\n   - Use a flexible prior for the noise term that can vary with `x1`.\n\n3. **Likelihood**:\n   - Define the likelihood of the observations using a normal distribution with a mean given by the polynomial regression and a noise term that varies with `x1`.\n\n### Probabilistic Program\n\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x1_data = observed_data['x1'].values\n    y_data = observed_data['y'].values\n\n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n\n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create a pm.MutableData object for each non-observation column\n        x1 = pm.MutableData(\"x1\", x1_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Priors for polynomial coefficients\n        beta0 = pm.Normal(\"beta0\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta1 = pm.Normal(\"beta1\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta2 = pm.Normal(\"beta2\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta3 = pm.Normal(\"beta3\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        \n        # Polynomial regression model\n        mu = beta0 + beta1 * x1 + beta2 * x1**2 + beta3 * x1**3\n        \n        # Heteroscedastic noise term\n        sigma = pm.HalfNormal(\"sigma\", sigma=10)\n        \n        # Likelihood of observations\n        y_obs = pm.Normal(\"y_obs\", mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=y_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sampling\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n- **Priors for Polynomial Coefficients**: We use normal priors for the polynomial coefficients (`beta0`, `beta1`, `beta2`, `beta3`) with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 10.\n- **Polynomial Regression Model**: The mean (`mu`) of the normal distribution is modeled as a third-degree polynomial of `x1`.\n- **Heteroscedastic Noise Term**: We use a half-normal prior for the noise term (`sigma`) to allow it to vary with `x1`.\n- **Likelihood of Observations**: The observations (`y_obs`) are modeled as normally distributed with mean `mu` and standard deviation `sigma`.\n\nThis model should be more flexible and better capture the relationship between `x1` and `y`, as well as the variability in the data."
