        "role:assistant, messaage:<thought>Given that the population increases significantly from time 0 to 1.25, and knowing that the population at time 0 is 95 and peaks at 315 at time 1.25, the population at time 0.5 should be somewhere between these values. Since 0.5 is closer to 0 than to 1.25, the population should be closer to 95 but still significantly higher. A reasonable estimate would be around halfway between 95 and 315.</thought>\n<answer>205</answer>",
