            "Based on the observations conducted, we have consistently seen that every population size tested resulted in 100% of the lab rats developing endometrial stromal polyps. The population sizes observed were 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and 100. In each case, the number of rats with polyps equaled the total population size, indicating an infection rate of 100%.\n\nGiven this consistent pattern, we can infer that the infection rate for endometrial stromal polyps in this population of lab rats is 100%. This means that regardless of the population size, every rat in the population is expected to develop the polyps.\n\nTo predict the number of lab rats that will develop endometrial stromal polyps for any given population size, you can simply assume that all rats in the population will be affected. For example, if you have a population of 35 rats, you can predict that all 35 rats will develop endometrial stromal polyps.\n\nThis consistent 100% infection rate simplifies the prediction process, as the number of affected rats will always equal the total population size."
