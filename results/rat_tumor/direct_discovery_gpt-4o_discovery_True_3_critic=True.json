            "Based on the observations, we can infer a pattern in the number of lab rats developing endometrial stromal polyps relative to the population size. Here are the results so far:\n\n- 2 out of 50\n- 1 out of 20\n- 7 out of 80\n- 3 out of 60\n- 1 out of 30\n- 4 out of 90\n- 1 out of 10\n- 3 out of 40\n- 6 out of 70\n- 1 out of 25\n\nFrom these data points, we can calculate the approximate infection rate by dividing the number of affected rats by the total population size. For example, for a population of 50, the infection rate is 2/50 = 0.04 or 4%. Similarly, for a population of 80, the infection rate is 7/80 = 0.0875 or 8.75%.\n\nThe infection rates vary but seem to hover around 4% to 8.75%. To predict the number of rats developing polyps in a new population size, you can use an average infection rate. Let's assume an average infection rate of 6%. For a population size \\( nR \\):\n\n\\[ tR = nR \\times 0.06 \\]\n\nFor example, for a population of 100 rats:\n\n\\[ tR = 100 \\times 0.06 = 6 \\]\n\nThus, you can expect approximately 6 rats to develop endometrial stromal polyps in a population of 100. Adjust this rate slightly based on the observed trend for more accurate predictions."
