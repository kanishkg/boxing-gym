            "Based on the observations, the infection rate of endometrial stromal polyps in lab rats appears to vary with population size.

However, for 30 rats, only 2 developed polyps, dropping the rate to 0.067.\n\n2. **Medium Populations**: For 50 rats, 3 developed polyps (rate of 0.06). For 70 rats, 6 developed polyps (rate of 0.086). For 90 rats, 8 developed polyps (rate of 0.089).\n\n3. **Large Populations**: For 100 rats, 12 developed polyps, giving an infection rate of 0.12. Revisiting smaller populations, 5 out of 40 rats (rate of 0.125) and 7 out of 60 rats (rate of 0.117) developed polyps.\n\nThe infection rate seems to stabilize around 0.12 for larger populations. This suggests that, on average, about 12% of the rats in a given population will develop endometrial stromal polyps. This rate can be used to predict the number of affected rats in different population sizes. For example, in a population of 50 rats, approximately 6 rats (50 * 0.12) are expected to develop polyps."
