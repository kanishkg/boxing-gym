            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset of ages and lengths of dugongs, we aim to model the relationship between the age (x) and the length (Y) of the dugongs. A reasonable starting point is to assume that the length of a dugong increases with age, but not necessarily in a linear fashion. A common model for such growth data is the Gompertz growth model, which is often used in biological contexts.\n\nThe Gompertz growth model can be expressed as:\n\\[ Y = \\alpha \\exp(-\\beta \\exp(-\\gamma x)) \\]\nwhere:\n- \\(\\alpha\\) is the asymptotic maximum length,\n- \\(\\beta\\) is a scaling parameter,\n- \\(\\gamma\\) is the growth rate.\n\nWe will assume that the observed lengths \\(Y\\) are normally distributed around the Gompertz model with some noise \\(\\sigma\\).\n\n### Plan\n1. Define priors for the parameters \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), \\(\\gamma\\), and \\(\\sigma\\).\n2. Use the Gompertz growth model to define the mean length \\(\\mu\\) as a function of age \\(x\\).\n3. Define the likelihood of the observed lengths \\(Y\\) given the mean length \\(\\mu\\) and noise \\(\\sigma\\).\n4. Sample from the posterior distribution and generate posterior predictive samples.\n\n### Probabilistic Program\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x_data = observed_data['x'].values\n    y_data = observed_data['Y'].values\n    \n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n    \n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create pm.MutableData objects for each non-observation column\n        x = pm.MutableData(\"x\", x_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Priors for the Gompertz growth model parameters\n        alpha = pm.Normal(\"alpha\", mu=3, sigma=1)\n        beta = pm.Normal(\"beta\", mu=1, sigma=1)\n        gamma = pm.Normal(\"gamma\", mu=1, sigma=1)\n        \n        # Gompertz growth model\n        mu = alpha * pm.math.exp(-beta * pm.math.exp(-gamma * x))\n        \n        # Prior for the noise\n        sigma = pm.HalfNormal(\"sigma\", sigma=1)\n        \n        # Likelihood of the observed data\n        y_obs = pm.Normal(\"y_obs\", mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=y_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sampling from the posterior\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        \n        # Posterior predictive sampling\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Priors**: We use normal priors for the parameters \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), and \\(\\gamma\\) with means and standard deviations chosen to reflect reasonable biological assumptions.\n- **Gompertz Model**: The mean length \\(\\mu\\) is modeled using the Gompertz growth function.\n- **Likelihood**: The observed lengths \\(Y\\) are assumed to be normally distributed around the mean length \\(\\mu\\) with noise \\(\\sigma\\).\n- **Sampling**: We sample from the posterior distribution and generate posterior predictive samples to compare with the observed data.\n\nThis model should provide a good starting point for capturing the relationship between age and length in dugongs. Further iterations can refine the model based on discrepancies between the actual data and the sampled data."
