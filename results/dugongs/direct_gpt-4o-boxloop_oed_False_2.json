            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset, we need to model the relationship between the input variable \\( x \\) and the output variable \\( Y \\). The data suggests a non-linear relationship, possibly quadratic or exponential. For the initial model, we will assume a simple linear relationship with Gaussian noise. This will serve as a baseline, and we can refine it in subsequent rounds based on the results.\n\n### Plan\n1. **Model the relationship between \\( x \\) and \\( Y \\)**: Start with a linear model \\( Y = \\alpha + \\beta x + \\epsilon \\), where \\( \\epsilon \\) is Gaussian noise.\n2. **Define priors**: Use weakly informative priors for the parameters \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\beta \\).\n3. **Likelihood**: Assume the observations \\( Y \\) are normally distributed around the linear model with some standard deviation \\( \\sigma \\).\n\n### Program\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x_data = observed_data['x'].values\n    y_data = observed_data['Y'].values\n\n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create a pm.MutableData object for each non-observation column\n        x = pm.MutableData(\"x\", x_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Priors for the parameters\n        alpha = pm.Normal(\"alpha\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta = pm.Normal(\"beta\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        sigma = pm.HalfNormal(\"sigma\", sigma=1)\n        \n        # Linear model\n        mu = alpha + beta * x\n        \n        # Likelihood\n        y_obs = pm.Normal(\"y_obs\", mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=y_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sampling\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=np.random.default_rng(42), idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=np.random.default_rng(314), return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n\n# Example usage\n# observed_data = pd.DataFrame({\n#     'x': [0.00, 5.00, 2.50, 1.00, 4.00, 2.00, 3.00, 3.50, 1.50, 3.75],\n#     'Y': [1.352086, 1.967628, 2.356167, 1.910333, 1.894796, 2.257472, 2.426864, 2.361653, 1.686697, 1.757477]\n# })\n# model, posterior_predictive, trace = gen_model(observed_data)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Priors**: We use normal priors for \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\beta \\) with mean 0 and standard deviation 10, which are weakly informative. The standard deviation \\( \\sigma \\) is given a half-normal prior to ensure it is positive.\n- **Likelihood**: The observations \\( y_obs \\) are modeled as normally distributed around the linear model \\( \\mu = \\alpha + \\beta x \\) with standard deviation \\( \\sigma \\).\n- **Sampling**: We sample from the posterior distribution using 1000 samples, 500 tuning steps, and a target acceptance rate of 0.90. We use 3 chains and set the random seed for reproducibility.\n\nThis initial model will serve as a baseline. Based on the results, we can refine the model to better capture the relationship between \\( x \\) and \\( Y \\)."
