            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset and the initial observations, we need to create a generative model that explains the relationship between `x` and `Y`. Since we don't have any prior information about the nature of this relationship, we can start with a simple linear regression model. This model assumes that `Y` is a linear function of `x` with some Gaussian noise.\n\n#### Hypotheses:\n1. **Linear Relationship**: `Y` is linearly dependent on `x`.\n2. **Gaussian Noise**: The noise in the observations follows a Gaussian distribution.\n\n### Plan:\n1. **Define Priors**: We will define priors for the slope and intercept of the linear relationship.\n2. **Likelihood**: We will define the likelihood of the observed data given the linear model and Gaussian noise.\n3. **Sampling**: We will sample from the posterior distribution to estimate the parameters.\n\n### Program:\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x_data = observed_data['x'].values\n    y_data = observed_data['Y'].values\n    \n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n    \n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create a pm.MutableData object for each non-observation column\n        x = pm.MutableData(\"x\", x_data, dims='obs_id')\n        \n        # Define priors for the slope and intercept\n        intercept = pm.Normal(\"intercept\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        slope = pm.Normal(\"slope\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        \n        # Define the linear model\n        mu = intercept + slope * x\n        \n        # Define the likelihood with Gaussian noise\n        sigma = pm.HalfNormal(\"sigma\", sigma=1)\n        y_obs = pm.Normal(\"y_obs\", mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=y_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sample from the posterior\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        \n        # Sample from the posterior predictive\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Priors**: We use normal distributions for the slope and intercept with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 10. This is a non-informative prior that allows for a wide range of possible values.\n- **Likelihood**: We assume that the observations `Y` are normally distributed around the linear model `mu` with a standard deviation `sigma`. The standard deviation `sigma` is given a half-normal prior to ensure it is positive.\n- **Sampling**: We use `pm.sample` to draw samples from the posterior distribution and `pm.sample_posterior_predictive` to generate posterior predictive samples.\n\nThis initial model is simple and assumes a linear relationship with Gaussian noise. If the model does not fit well, we can revise it in subsequent rounds based on the discrepancies between the actual data and the sampled data.",

We can refine the model in subsequent rounds based on the discrepancies between the actual data and the sampled data."
