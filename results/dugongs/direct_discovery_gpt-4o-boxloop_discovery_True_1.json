            "To predict the length of a sea cow given its age, we can use a linear growth model based on observed data. This model assumes that the length of the sea cow increases linearly with age, plus some random variation.\n\nThe model has three key parameters:\n1. **Intercept (alpha)**: This is the starting length of the sea cow at age 0. In our case, it is approximately 0.673 units.\n2. **Slope (beta)**: This represents the rate of growth per unit of age. For our sea cows, the length increases by about 0.172 units for each year of age.\n3. **Noise (sigma)**: This accounts for the natural variability in growth that isn't explained by the linear trend. Here, the standard deviation of this noise is about 0.261 units.\n\nUsing these parameters, the length of a sea cow at any given age can be estimated with the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Length} = \\alpha + \\beta \\times \\text{Age} \\]\nSo, for example, at age 3, the predicted length would be:\n\\[ \\text{Length} = 0.673 + 0.172 \\times 3 = 1.189 \\text{ units} \\]\n\nKeep in mind that actual lengths may vary slightly due to natural variability (sigma). This model provides a good approximation based on the observed data."
