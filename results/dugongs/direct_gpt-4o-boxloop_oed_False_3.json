            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset and the initial observations, we need to create a generative model that explains the relationship between the input `x` and the output `Y`. \n\n#### Hypotheses:\n1. There might be a linear relationship between `x` and `Y`.\n2. The variance of `Y` might be constant across different values of `x`.\n\n#### Plan:\n1. Use a linear regression model to capture the relationship between `x` and `Y`.\n2. Assume a normal distribution for the residuals with a constant variance.\n\n### Probabilistic Program\n\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x_data = observed_data['x'].values\n    y_data = observed_data['Y'].values\n    \n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n    \n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create a pm.MutableData object for each non-observation column\n        x = pm.MutableData(\"x\", x_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Define priors for the linear regression parameters\n        intercept = pm.Normal(\"intercept\", mu=0, sigma=1)\n        slope = pm.Normal(\"slope\", mu=0, sigma=1)\n        sigma = pm.HalfNormal(\"sigma\", sigma=1)\n        \n        # Define the linear model\n        mu = intercept + slope * x\n        \n        # Define the likelihood of the observations\n        y_obs = pm.Normal(\"y_obs\", mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=y_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sample from the posterior\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        \n        # Sample from the posterior predictive\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Data Conversion**: The observed data columns are converted to numpy arrays for easier manipulation.\n2. **Model Definition**: \n   - **Mutable Data**: The input feature `x` is wrapped in a `pm.MutableData` container.\n   - **Priors**: Priors for the intercept, slope, and standard deviation (`sigma`) are defined using normal and half-normal distributions.\n   - **Linear Model**: A linear relationship between `x` and `Y` is assumed.\n   - **Likelihood**: The likelihood of the observations is defined using a normal distribution with mean `mu` and standard deviation `sigma`.\n3. **Sampling**: \n   - **Posterior Sampling**: Samples are drawn from the posterior distribution.\n   - **Posterior Predictive Sampling**: Samples are drawn from the posterior predictive distribution to generate predictions.\n\nThis initial model assumes a simple linear relationship between `x` and `Y`. Based on the results and discrepancies, we can refine the model in subsequent rounds.",
            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset and the observed relationship between `x` and `Y`, it appears that `Y` might be a non-linear function of `x`. A common approach to modeling such relationships is to use polynomial regression or a more flexible model like a spline. For simplicity, let's start with a polynomial regression model of degree 2 (quadratic model).\n\n### Plan\n1. **Model**: Assume `Y` is a quadratic function of `x` with some Gaussian noise.\n2. **Priors**: Use weakly informative priors for the coefficients of the polynomial and the noise term.\n3. **Likelihood**: Model the observed `Y` values as normally distributed around the polynomial function of `x`.\n\n### Program\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x = observed_data['x'].values\n    y = observed_data['Y'].values\n    \n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n    \n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create a pm.MutableData object for each non-observation column\n        x_data = pm.MutableData(\"x\", x, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Priors for the coefficients of the polynomial\n        a = pm.Normal(\"a\", mu=0, sigma=1)\n        b = pm.Normal(\"b\", mu=0, sigma=1)\n        c = pm.Normal(\"c\", mu=0, sigma=1)\n        \n        # Prior for the noise term\n        sigma = pm.HalfNormal(\"sigma\", sigma=1)\n        \n        # Quadratic model\n        mu = a + b * x_data + c * x_data**2\n        \n        # Likelihood\n        y_obs = pm.Normal(\"y_obs\", mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=y, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sampling\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Priors**: We use normal priors for the coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c` of the quadratic model, centered at 0 with a standard deviation of 1. This is a weakly informative prior.\n- **Noise Term**: We use a half-normal prior for the noise term `sigma` to ensure it is positive.\n- **Likelihood**: The observed `Y` values are modeled as normally distributed around the quadratic function of `x` with the specified noise term.\n\nThis initial model should capture the non-linear relationship between `x` and `Y`. If the fit is not satisfactory, we can consider more complex models in subsequent rounds."
