            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset of ages and lengths of dugongs, we aim to model the relationship between the age (x) and the length (Y) of the dugongs. A reasonable starting point is to assume that the length of a dugong increases with age, but not necessarily in a linear fashion. A common model for such growth data is the Gompertz growth model, which is often used to describe growth processes.\n\nThe Gompertz model can be expressed as:\n\\[ Y = \\alpha \\exp(-\\beta \\exp(-\\gamma x)) \\]\nwhere:\n- \\(\\alpha\\) is the asymptotic maximum length,\n- \\(\\beta\\) is a scaling parameter,\n- \\(\\gamma\\) is the growth rate.\n\nWe will assume that the observed lengths \\(Y\\) are normally distributed around the Gompertz model with some noise \\(\\sigma\\).\n\n### Plan\n1. Define priors for the parameters \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), \\(\\gamma\\), and \\(\\sigma\\).\n2. Use the Gompertz model to define the mean length \\(\\mu\\) as a function of age \\(x\\).\n3. Define the likelihood of the observed lengths \\(Y\\) given the mean length \\(\\mu\\) and noise \\(\\sigma\\).\n4.

The noise \\(\\sigma\\) is given a half-normal prior to ensure it is positive.\n- **Gompertz Model**: The mean length \\(\\mu\\) is modeled using the Gompertz function.\n- **Likelihood**: The observed lengths \\(Y\\) are assumed to be normally distributed around the mean length \\(\\mu\\) with noise \\(\\sigma\\).\n- **Sampling**: We sample from the posterior distribution and the posterior predictive distribution to obtain the model, posterior predictive samples, and trace.\n\nThis model should provide a good starting point for capturing the relationship between the age and length of dugongs."
