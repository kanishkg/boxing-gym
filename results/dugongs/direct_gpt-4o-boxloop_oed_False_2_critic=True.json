            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset and the initial hypotheses, we need to create a generative model that captures the relationship between `x` and `Y`. The initial hypotheses suggest that a simple linear model might be too simplistic and that the priors for the parameters might not be informative enough. Additionally, the standard deviation might be too restrictive.\n\nTo address these hypotheses, we can consider the following improvements:\n1. Use a polynomial regression model to capture potential non-linear relationships between `x` and `Y`.\n2. Use more informative priors for the parameters based on domain knowledge or prior data.\n3. Allow for a more flexible standard deviation to better capture the variability in the data.\n\n### Plan\n1. **Model Structure**: Use a polynomial regression model of degree 2 (quadratic) to capture potential non-linear relationships.\n2. **Priors**: Use more informative priors for the coefficients of the polynomial regression.\n3. **Standard Deviation**: Use a more flexible prior for the standard deviation.\n\n### Program\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x_data = observed_data['x'].values\n    y_data = observed_data['Y'].values\n    \n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n    \n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create pm.MutableData objects for each non-observation column\n        x = pm.MutableData(\"x\", x_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Priors for polynomial regression coefficients\n        alpha = pm.Normal(\"alpha\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta1 = pm.Normal(\"beta1\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta2 = pm.Normal(\"beta2\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        \n        # Polynomial regression model\n        mu = alpha + beta1 * x + beta2 * x**2\n        \n        # Prior for standard deviation\n        sigma = pm.HalfNormal(\"sigma\", sigma=10)\n        \n        # Likelihood\n        y_obs = pm.Normal(\"y_obs\", mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=y_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sampling\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Polynomial Regression**: We use a quadratic polynomial regression model (`mu = alpha + beta1 * x + beta2 * x**2`) to capture potential non-linear relationships between `x` and `Y`.\n- **Priors**: We use Normal priors for the coefficients (`alpha`, `beta1`, `beta2`) with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 10, which are more informative than the previous broad priors.\n- **Standard Deviation**: We use a HalfNormal prior for the standard deviation (`sigma`) with a standard deviation of 10 to allow for more flexibility in capturing the variability in the data.\n- **Sampling**: We sample from the posterior distribution and the posterior predictive distribution to obtain the model, posterior predictive samples, and trace.\n\nThis model should provide a better fit to the data by capturing potential non-linear relationships and allowing for more flexibility in the standard deviation.",
