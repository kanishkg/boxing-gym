            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset of ages and lengths of dugongs, we aim to model the relationship between the age (x) and the length (Y) of the dugongs. A reasonable starting point is to assume that the length of a dugong is a function of its age, possibly with some noise. A common approach is to use a linear or polynomial regression model to capture this relationship.\n\n#### Hypotheses:\n1. The length of a dugong increases with age, but not necessarily in a strictly linear fashion.\n2. There is some inherent variability in the length of dugongs that cannot be explained solely by age.\n\n#### Plan:\n1. Use a polynomial regression model to capture the relationship between age and length.\n2. Assume a normal distribution for the observed lengths with a mean given by the polynomial regression and some standard deviation (sigma).\n\n### Probabilistic Program\n\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    age = observed_data['x'].values\n    length = observed_data['Y'].values\n    \n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n    \n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create a pm.MutableData object for each non-observation column\n        x = pm.MutableData(\"x\", age, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Define priors for the polynomial regression coefficients\n        intercept = pm.Normal(\"intercept\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta_1 = pm.Normal(\"beta_1\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta_2 = pm.Normal(\"beta_2\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        \n        # Polynomial regression model\n        mu = intercept + beta_1 * x + beta_2 * x**2\n        \n        # Define prior for the standard deviation of the observations\n        sigma = pm.HalfNormal(\"sigma\", sigma=1)\n        \n        # Likelihood of the observations\n        y_obs = pm.Normal(\"y_obs\", mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=length, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sampling\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Data Conversion**: The observed data columns are converted to numpy arrays for easier manipulation.\n2. **Model Definition**: \n   - `x` is defined as a `pm.MutableData` object to allow for future updates.\n   - Priors for the polynomial regression coefficients (`intercept`, `beta_1`, `beta_2`) are defined as normal distributions.\n   - The polynomial regression model is defined as `mu = intercept + beta_1 * x + beta_2 * x**2`.\n   - The standard deviation (`sigma`) of the observations is defined as a half-normal distribution.\n   - The likelihood of the observations (`y_obs`) is defined as a normal distribution with mean `mu` and standard deviation `sigma`.\n3. **Sampling**: The model is sampled using `pm.sample` with specified parameters for reproducibility and efficiency. The posterior predictive samples are also generated.\n\nThis initial model captures the potential non-linear relationship between age and length while accounting for variability in the observations.",

            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset of ages and lengths of dugongs, we need to model the relationship between age (x) and length (Y). Based on the hypotheses and synthesis provided, a simple linear model may not be sufficient.
