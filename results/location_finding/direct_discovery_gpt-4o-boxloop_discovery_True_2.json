            "To predict signal intensity at any given point without knowing the exact locations of the sources, you can use the following heuristic guidelines:\n\n1. **Proximity Matters**: Signal intensity is generally higher when you are closer to the sources. If you observe a high signal at a point, the sources are likely nearby. Conversely, a low signal suggests the sources are farther away.\n\n2. **Gradient Observation**: Measure the signal at multiple points around your area of interest. If the signal drops sharply as you move away from a point, it indicates that a source is close to that point. If the signal decreases gradually, the sources are likely farther away.\n\n3. **Symmetry and Asymmetry**: If the signal intensity is similar in different directions from a point, the sources might be symmetrically distributed around that point. If the signal varies significantly in different directions, the sources are likely asymmetrically distributed.\n\n4. **Combine Observations**: Use multiple measurements to triangulate the likely positions of the sources. For example, if you have high signals at [0, 0] and [-1, -1], but lower signals at [1, 0] and [0, 1], the sources are likely closer to the negative x and y coordinates.\n\n5. **Inverse Distance Relationship**: Signal strength typically decreases with the square of the distance from the source. If you know the signal strength at one point, you can estimate the signal at another point by considering the relative distances.\n\nBy systematically measuring and analyzing the signal intensities at various points, you can make educated predictions about the signal intensity at new locations."
