            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset and the description, we need to model the signal strength at any point in the grid as a superposition of signals from three unknown sources. Each source emits a signal of identical strength. The signal strength at any point is likely a function of the distance from these sources.\n\n#### Hypotheses:\n1. The signal strength decreases with distance from the source.\n2. There are three sources, and their locations are unknown.\n3.

The signal strength at any point is inversely related to the distance from the sources.\n2. There are three sources, and their locations are unknown.\n3. Each source emits a signal of identical strength.\n\n#### Plan:\n1. Define the locations of the three sources as latent variables.\n2.
