            "To predict signal intensity at any given point without knowing the source locations, follow these general heuristic guidelines:\n\n1. **Observe Symmetry and Gradients**: From the measurements, we see that signal intensity varies with direction. For example, intensity decreases along the positive x and y axes but increases in the negative y direction. This suggests an asymmetric distribution.\n\n2. **Quadrant Analysis**: Higher intensities were observed in the negative x and y quadrant and the positive x and negative y quadrant. This indicates that sources might be located in these regions, causing higher intensities.\n\n3. **Distance Effect**: Signal intensity generally decreases as you move away from regions of high intensity. For instance, moving from (0, -1) to (0, -2) showed a decrease in intensity.\n\n4. **Directional Trends**: Intensities are higher in the negative y direction and lower in the positive y direction. Similarly, intensities are higher in the negative x direction compared to the positive x direction.\n\nUsing these guidelines, you can predict that points closer to the negative y-axis and negative x-axis will have higher intensities, while points further away in the positive x and y directions will have lower intensities. This approach allows you to make reasonable predictions without knowing the exact source locations."

        "role:assistant, messaage:<thought>Given the location [-0.67124613, -0.0126646], it is in the negative x direction and close to the origin. Based on the heuristic guidelines, the intensity should be relatively high but not at the peak since it is not deep into the negative y direction. Considering the final result is 1.77, I will estimate the intensity to be slightly lower than this value.</thought>\n<answer>1.70</answer>"
