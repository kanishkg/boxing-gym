            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset and the task, we need to model the relationship between the 2-dimensional vectors (x1, x2) and the associated floating-point number y. Since we don't have any prior information about the nature of this relationship, we can start with a simple linear regression model. This model assumes that y is a linear combination of x1 and x2 plus some Gaussian noise.\n\n#### Hypotheses:\n1. The relationship between x1, x2, and y can be captured by a linear model.\n2. The noise in the observations follows a normal distribution.\n\n### Plan:\n1. Define the priors for the coefficients of the linear model and the noise term.\n2. Use the observed data to define the likelihood of the observations.\n3. Sample from the posterior distribution to estimate the model parameters.\n\n### Program:\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x1_data = observed_data['x1'].values\n    x2_data = observed_data['x2'].values\n    y_data = observed_data['y'].values\n\n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n    \n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create pm.MutableData objects for each non-observation column\n        x1 = pm.MutableData(\"x1\", x1_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        x2 = pm.MutableData(\"x2\", x2_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Priors for the coefficients and intercept\n        intercept = pm.Normal(\"intercept\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta_x1 = pm.Normal(\"beta_x1\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta_x2 = pm.Normal(\"beta_x2\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        \n        # Linear model\n        mu = intercept + beta_x1 * x1 + beta_x2 * x2\n        \n        # Prior for the noise term\n        sigma = pm.HalfNormal(\"sigma\", sigma=1)\n        \n        # Likelihood of the observations\n        y_obs = pm.Normal(\"y_obs\", mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=y_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sampling from the posterior\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Priors**: We assume normal priors for the intercept and the coefficients (beta_x1, beta_x2) with mean 0 and standard deviation 10. This is a common choice when we don't have strong prior information.\n- **Linear Model**: The mean of the observations (mu) is modeled as a linear combination of x1 and x2.\n- **Noise Term**: We assume the noise follows a half-normal distribution with a standard deviation of 1.\n- **Likelihood**: The observed y values are assumed to follow a normal distribution with mean mu and standard deviation sigma.\n- **Sampling**: We sample from the posterior distribution to estimate the model parameters and generate posterior predictive samples.\n\nThis initial model is simple and should provide a good starting point. We can refine it in subsequent rounds based on the discrepancies between the actual data and the sampled data.",

This model assumes that y is a linear combination of x1 and x2 plus some Gaussian noise.\n\n#### Hypotheses:\n1. The relationship between x1, x2, and y can be captured by a linear model.\n2. The noise in the observations follows a normal distribution.\n\n### Plan:\n1. Define the priors for the coefficients of the linear model and the noise term.\n2. Use the observed data to define the likelihood of the observations.\n3. Sample from the posterior distribution to estimate the model parameters.\n\n### Program:\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x1_data = observed_data['x1'].values\n    x2_data = observed_data['x2'].values\n    y_data = observed_data['y'].values\n\n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n    \n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create pm.MutableData objects for each non-observation column\n        x1 = pm.MutableData(\"x1\", x1_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        x2 = pm.MutableData(\"x2\", x2_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Define priors for the coefficients and noise term\n        beta_x1 = pm.Normal(\"beta_x1\", mu=0, sigma=1)\n        beta_x2 = pm.Normal(\"beta_x2\", mu=0, sigma=1)\n        intercept = pm.Normal(\"intercept\", mu=0, sigma=1)\n        sigma = pm.HalfNormal(\"sigma\", sigma=1)\n        \n        # Define the linear model\n        mu = intercept + beta_x1 * x1 + beta_x2 * x2\n        \n        # Define the likelihood of the observations\n        y_obs = pm.Normal(\"y_obs\", mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=y_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sample from the posterior\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Priors**: We assume normal priors for the coefficients (`beta_x1`, `beta_x2`, and `intercept`) and a half-normal prior for the noise term (`sigma`).\n2. **Linear Model**: The mean (`mu`) of the normal distribution for `y` is defined as a linear combination of `x1` and `x2` plus an intercept.\n3. **Likelihood**: The observed data `y` is assumed to follow a normal distribution with mean `mu` and standard deviation `sigma`.\n4. **Sampling**: We sample from the posterior distribution to estimate the model parameters and generate posterior predictive samples.\n\nThis initial model is simple and assumes a linear relationship between the predictors and the response variable. Based on the results, we can refine the model in subsequent rounds."
