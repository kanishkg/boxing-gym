The relationship between \\( y \\) and the input features \\( x1 \\) and \\( x2 \\) is linear.\n2. The noise in the observations is normally distributed.\n\n### Plan:\n1. Define a linear model where \\( y \\) is a function of \\( x1 \\) and \\( x2 \\).\n2. Assume Gaussian noise for the observations.\n3. Use PyMC to define the probabilistic model and sample from the posterior.\n\n### Probabilistic Program\n\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x1_data = observed_data['x1'].to_numpy()\n    x2_data = observed_data['x2'].to_numpy()\n    y_data = observed_data['y'].to_numpy()\n    \n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n    \n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create pm.MutableData objects for each non-observation column\n        x1 = pm.MutableData(\"x1\", x1_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        x2 = pm.MutableData(\"x2\", x2_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Define priors for the linear model coefficients and intercept\n        intercept = pm.Normal(\"intercept\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta_x1 = pm.Normal(\"beta_x1\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta_x2 = pm.Normal(\"beta_x2\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        \n        # Define the linear model\n        mu = intercept + beta_x1 * x1 + beta_x2 * x2\n        \n        # Define the likelihood with Gaussian noise\n        sigma = pm.HalfNormal(\"sigma\", sigma=1)\n        y_obs = pm.Normal(\"y_obs\", mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=y_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sample from the posterior\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        \n        # Sample from the posterior predictive\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Data Conversion**: Convert the observed data columns to numpy arrays for easier manipulation.\n2. **Model Definition**: \n   - Define priors for the intercept and coefficients of the linear model.\n   - Define the linear relationship between \\( y \\) and the input features \\( x1 \\) and \\( x2 \\).\n   - Assume Gaussian noise for the observations.\n3. **Sampling**: \n   - Sample from the posterior distribution of the model parameters.\n   - Sample from the posterior predictive distribution to generate predictions.\n\nThis initial model assumes a simple linear relationship with Gaussian noise. If the model does not fit well, we can consider more complex models in subsequent rounds."
