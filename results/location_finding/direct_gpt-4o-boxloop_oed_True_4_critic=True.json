The model may not be capturing the true spatial distribution of the sources, leading to discrepancies in signal strength predictions.\n2. The uniform priors for the source locations might be too simplistic, failing to account for potential clustering or specific patterns in the source locations.\n3. The assumption of a single amplitude (A) for all sources might be incorrect; different sources could have varying amplitudes.\n4. The Gaussian spread (sigma) might not be adequately capturing the spatial influence of the sources, leading to over- or underestimation of signal strengths.\n\n#### Plan:\n1. Use more informative priors for the source locations.\n2. Allow for varying amplitudes for each source.\n3. Use different spreads (sigma) for each source.\n4.
