            "To predict signal intensity at any given point without knowing the exact source locations, consider the following heuristic guidelines:\n\n1. **Distance Matters**: Signal intensity generally decreases as you move away from the sources. Points closer to the sources will have higher intensities. Even without knowing the exact locations, you can infer that areas with higher measured intensities are likely closer to one or more sources.\n\n2. **Superposition Principle**: The total signal at any point is the sum of contributions from all sources. If you observe a high intensity at a point, it likely means that point is influenced by multiple sources.\n\n3. **Gradient Observation**: By measuring signal intensities at various points, you can identify gradients. A steep gradient (rapid change in intensity) suggests proximity to a source. Conversely, a shallow gradient indicates you are farther from the sources.\n\n4. **Symmetry and Patterns**: If you find a high-intensity point, measure symmetrically around it. This helps in identifying the direction in which the intensity decreases, giving clues about the source locations.\n\n5. **Iterative Refinement**: Start with a broad grid of measurements and then focus on areas with higher intensities. This iterative approach helps in honing in on the regions with sources.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can make educated predictions about signal intensities across the grid without needing to know the exact source locations."
