        "role:system, messaage:Here is what you know about the environment:\nTo predict the scalar value for any given 2-dimensional vector, we can use a linear regression model with some added complexity to account for non-linear behavior. The model assumes that the value at any point \\((x_1, x_2)\\) can be predicted using a linear combination of \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\), along with an intercept and some noise.\n\nThe inferred parameters from the model are:\n- \\( \\beta_{x1} \\approx 0.004 \\): This coefficient suggests that \\(x_1\\) has a very small positive effect on the value.\n- \\( \\beta_{x2} \\approx -0.733 \\): This coefficient indicates that \\(x_2\\) has a significant negative effect on the value.\n- Intercept \\( \\approx 1.287 \\): This is the baseline value when both \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) are zero.\n- Sigma \\( \\approx 0.750 \\): This represents the noise or variability in the data that isn't explained by the linear relationship.\n\nConceptually, the value at any point can be estimated using the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Value} \\approx 1.287 + 0.004 \\cdot x_1 - 0.733 \\cdot x_2 \\]\n\nThis means that as \\(x_2\\) increases, the value tends to decrease significantly, while \\(x_1\\) has a minimal positive impact. The intercept provides a starting point, and the noise term accounts for variations that the linear model doesn't capture. This approach helps in making reliable predictions even with some underlying complexity in the data.",
