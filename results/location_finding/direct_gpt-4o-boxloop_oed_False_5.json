Convert the observed data columns to numpy arrays.\n2. Create a `pm.MutableData` object for each non-observation column.\n3. Define the linear model for the floating-point number.\n4. Define the likelihood of the observations using a normal distribution with the mean given by the linear model and some standard deviation.\n5. Sample from the prior predictive distribution.\n\n### Program\n\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x1_data = np.array(observed_data['x1'])\n    x2_data = np.array(observed_data['x2'])\n    \n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n    \n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create a pm.MutableData object for each non-observation column\n        x1 = pm.MutableData(\"x1\", x1_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        x2 = pm.MutableData(\"x2\", x2_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Define the linear model\n        intercept = pm.Normal(\"intercept\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        slope_x1 = pm.Normal(\"slope_x1\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        slope_x2 = pm.Normal(\"slope_x2\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        \n        mu = intercept + slope_x1 * x1 + slope_x2 * x2\n        \n        # Define the likelihood of the observations\n        sigma = pm.HalfNormal(\"sigma\", sigma=1)\n        y_obs = pm.Normal(\"y_obs\", mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=None, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sample from the prior predictive distribution\n        prior_predictive = pm.sample_prior_predictive(samples=1000, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, prior_predictive\n\n# Example usage:\n# observed_data = {'x1': [1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 'x2': [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]}\n# model, prior_predictive = gen_model(observed_data)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Data Conversion**: The observed data columns `x1` and `x2` are converted to numpy arrays.\n- **MutableData**: `pm.MutableData` objects are created for `x1` and `x2` with `dims=\"obs_id\"`.\n- **Linear Model**: The linear model is defined with an intercept and slopes for `x1` and `x2`.\n- **Likelihood**: The likelihood of the observations is defined as a normal distribution with mean `mu` and standard deviation `sigma`.\n- **Prior Predictive Sampling**: Samples are drawn from the prior predictive distribution to understand the prior model behavior.\n\nThis program sets up a generative model for the data and samples from the prior predictive distribution.",
            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset and the observations, we need to model the relationship between the 2-dimensional vectors (x1, x2) and the associated floating-point number y. Since we don't have any prior information about the nature of this relationship, we can start with a simple linear regression model. This model assumes that y is a linear combination of x1 and x2 plus some noise.\n\n#### Hypotheses:\n1. The relationship between (x1, x2) and y is linear.\n2. The noise in the observations is normally distributed.\n\n### Plan:\n1. Define the priors for the intercept and coefficients of the linear model.\n2. Define the likelihood of the observations using a normal distribution.\n3. Use the observed data to update the model and draw samples from the posterior.\n\n### Program:\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x1_data = observed_data['x1'].values\n    x2_data = observed_data['x2'].values\n    y_data = observed_data['y'].values\n\n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n\n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create pm.MutableData objects for each non-observation column\n        x1 = pm.MutableData(\"x1\", x1_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        x2 = pm.MutableData(\"x2\", x2_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n\n        # Priors for the intercept and coefficients\n        intercept = pm.Normal(\"intercept\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta_x1 = pm.Normal(\"beta_x1\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta_x2 = pm.Normal(\"beta_x2\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        \n        # Linear model\n        mu = intercept + beta_x1 * x1 + beta_x2 * x2\n        \n        # Likelihood of the observations\n        sigma = pm.HalfNormal(\"sigma\", sigma=1)\n        y_obs = pm.Normal(\"y_obs\", mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=y_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n\n        # Sampling\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n\n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Data Conversion**: The observed data columns are converted to numpy arrays for easier manipulation.\n2. **Model Definition**: \n   - `pm.MutableData` is used to create mutable data objects for `x1` and `x2`.\n   - Priors for the intercept and coefficients are defined using normal distributions.\n   - The linear model is defined as `mu = intercept + beta_x1 * x1 + beta_x2 * x2`.\n   - The likelihood of the observations is defined using a normal distribution with mean `mu` and standard deviation `sigma`.\n3. **Sampling**: The model is sampled using `pm.sample` and posterior predictive samples are drawn using `pm.sample_posterior_predictive`.\n\nThis initial model assumes a simple linear relationship between the input features and the output. Based on the results, we can refine the model in subsequent rounds.",
            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset, we need to model the relationship between the 2-dimensional vectors (x1, x2) and the associated floating-point number y. Since we don't have any prior information about the nature of this relationship, we can start with a simple linear regression model. This model assumes that y is a linear combination of x1 and x2 plus some Gaussian noise.\n\n### Plan\n1. **Model**: Assume a linear relationship between x1, x2, and y.\n2. **Parameters**: \n   - Intercept (\u03b1)\n   - Coefficients for x1 and x2 (\u03b21, \u03b22)\n   - Noise term (\u03c3)\n3. **Likelihood**: y is normally distributed with mean (\u03b1 + \u03b21 * x1 + \u03b22 * x2) and standard deviation \u03c3.\n\n### Program\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x1_data = observed_data['x1'].to_numpy()\n    x2_data = observed_data['x2'].to_numpy()\n    y_data = observed_data['y'].to_numpy()\n    \n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n    \n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create pm.MutableData objects for each non-observation column\n        x1 = pm.MutableData(\"x1\", x1_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        x2 = pm.MutableData(\"x2\", x2_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Define priors for the intercept and coefficients\n        alpha = pm.Normal(\"alpha\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta1 = pm.Normal(\"beta1\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta2 = pm.Normal(\"beta2\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        sigma = pm.HalfNormal(\"sigma\", sigma=1)\n        \n        # Define the linear model\n        mu = alpha + beta1 * x1 + beta2 * x2\n        \n        # Define the likelihood\n        y_obs = pm.Normal(\"y_obs\", mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=y_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sample from the posterior\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        \n        # Sample from the posterior predictive\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Priors**: We use normal priors for the intercept (\u03b1) and coefficients (\u03b21, \u03b22) with mean 0 and standard deviation 10, which are fairly uninformative. The noise term (\u03c3) is modeled as a half-normal distribution to ensure it is positive.\n- **Likelihood**: The observed data y is assumed to be normally distributed around the linear combination of x1 and x2 with the specified noise term \u03c3.\n- **Sampling**: We sample from the posterior distribution using 1000 samples with 500 tuning steps, and we set the target acceptance rate to 0.90 for better convergence. We also sample from the posterior predictive distribution to generate predictions.\n\nThis initial model is simple and assumes a linear relationship. If the model does not fit well, we can consider more complex models in subsequent rounds."
