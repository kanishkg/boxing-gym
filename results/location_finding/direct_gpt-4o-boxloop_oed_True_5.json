            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset and the description, we need to model the signal strength at any point in the grid as a superposition of signals from three unknown sources. Each source emits a signal of identical strength. The signal strength at any point is likely to be a function of the distance from these sources.\n\n#### Hypotheses:\n1. The signal strength decreases with distance from the source.\n2. There are three sources, and their locations are unknown.\n3. Each source emits a signal of identical strength.\n\n#### Plan:\n1. Define the locations of the three sources as latent variables.\n2. Model the signal strength at any point as a function of the distances from these sources.\n3. Use a suitable function to model the decrease in signal strength with distance (e.g., inverse square law).\n4.

            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset and the description, we need to model the signal strength at any point in the grid as a superposition of signals from three unknown sources. Each source emits a signal of identical strength. The signal strength at any point is likely to be a function of the distance from these sources.\n\n#### Hypotheses:\n1. The signal strength decreases with distance from the source.\n2. There are three sources, and their locations are unknown.\n3. Each source emits a signal of identical strength.\n\n#### Plan:\n1. Define the locations of the three sources as latent variables.\n2. Model the signal strength at any point as a function of the distances from these sources.\n3. Use a suitable function to model the decrease in signal strength with distance (e.g., inverse square law).\n\n### Probabilistic Program\n\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x1 = observed_data['x1'].values\n    x2 = observed_data['x2'].values\n    signal_strength = observed_data['signal_strength'].values\n\n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create pm.MutableData objects for each non-observation column\n        x1_data = pm.MutableData(\"x1\", x1, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        x2_data = pm.MutableData(\"x2\", x2, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Define priors for the unknown source locations\n        source_x1 = pm.Uniform(\"source_x1\", lower=0, upper=10, shape=3)\n        source_x2 = pm.Uniform(\"source_x2\", lower=0, upper=10, shape=3)\n        \n        # Define the signal strength decay function\n        def signal_decay(x1, x2, source_x1, source_x2):\n            distances = np.sqrt((x1[:, None] - source_x1[None, :])**2 + (x2[:, None] - source_x2[None, :])**2)\n            return 1 / (distances**2 + 1e-6)  # Adding a small constant to avoid division by zero\n        \n        # Calculate the total signal strength as the sum of signals from all sources\n        total_signal = pm.Deterministic(\"total_signal\", pm.math.sum(signal_decay(x1_data, x2_data, source_x1, source_x2), axis=1))\n        \n        # Define the likelihood\n        y_obs = pm.Normal(\"y_obs\", mu=total_signal, sigma=0.1, observed=signal_strength, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sample from the posterior\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=np.random.default_rng(42), idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=np.random.default_rng(314), return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Latent Variables for Source Locations**: We define the locations of the three sources (`source_x1` and `source_x2`) as latent variables with uniform priors over the grid.\n2. **Signal Decay Function**: We model the signal strength decay as an inverse square law function of the distance from the sources.\n3. **Total Signal Strength**: The total signal strength at any point is the sum of the signals from all sources.\n4. **Likelihood**: We assume the observed signal strength follows a normal distribution centered around the total signal strength with a small standard deviation (`sigma=0.1`).\n\nThis model should capture the essential characteristics of the data, given the hypotheses and the provided dataset."
