            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset and the description, we need to model the signal strength at any point in the grid as a superposition of signals from three unknown sources. Each source emits a signal of identical strength. The signal strength at any point is likely influenced by the distance from these sources.\n\n#### Hypotheses:\n1. The signal strength at any point is inversely related to the distance from the sources.\n2. There are three sources, and their locations are unknown.\n3. Each source emits a signal of identical strength.\n\n#### Plan:\n1. Define the locations of the three sources as latent variables.\n2. Model the signal strength at any point as a function of the distances from these sources.\n3.

            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset and the description, we need to model the signal strength at any point in the grid as a superposition of signals from three unknown sources. Each source emits a signal of identical strength. The signal strength at any point is likely influenced by the distance from these sources.\n\n#### Hypotheses:\n1. The signal strength at any point is inversely related to the distance from the sources.\n2. There are three sources, and their locations are unknown.\n3. Each source emits a signal of identical strength.\n\n#### Plan:\n1. Define the locations of the three sources as latent variables.\n2. Model the signal strength at any point as a function of the distances from these sources.\n3. Use a suitable distribution to model the noise in the observed signal strength.\n\n### Probabilistic Program\n\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x1 = observed_data['x1'].values\n    x2 = observed_data['x2'].values\n    signal_strength = observed_data['signal_strength'].values\n\n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n    \n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create pm.MutableData objects for each non-observation column\n        x1_data = pm.MutableData(\"x1\", x1, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        x2_data = pm.MutableData(\"x2\", x2, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Define the locations of the three sources as latent variables\n        source_x1 = pm.Uniform(\"source_x1\", lower=0, upper=1, shape=3)\n        source_x2 = pm.Uniform(\"source_x2\", lower=0, upper=1, shape=3)\n        \n        # Calculate the distances from each source to each observation point\n        distances = pm.math.sqrt((x1_data[:, None] - source_x1[None, :])**2 + \n                                 (x2_data[:, None] - source_x2[None, :])**2)\n        \n        # Model the signal strength as a function of the distances\n        signal_strength_mu = pm.math.sum(1 / distances, axis=1)\n        \n        # Define the likelihood of the observations\n        y_obs = pm.Normal(\"y_obs\", mu=signal_strength_mu, sigma=0.1, observed=signal_strength, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sample from the posterior\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n1. **Data Preparation**: Convert the observed data columns to numpy arrays.\n2. **Model Definition**:\n   - **Latent Variables**: Define the locations of the three sources (`source_x1` and `source_x2`) as uniform distributions between 0 and 1.\n   - **Distance Calculation**: Calculate the Euclidean distances from each source to each observation point.\n   - **Signal Strength Model**: Model the signal strength as the sum of the inverse distances from the sources.\n   - **Likelihood**: Define the likelihood of the observed signal strength using a normal distribution with a small standard deviation (`sigma=0.1`).\n3. **Sampling**: Sample from the posterior distribution and the posterior predictive distribution.\n\nThis model should capture the superposition of signals from three sources and provide a good fit to the observed data."
