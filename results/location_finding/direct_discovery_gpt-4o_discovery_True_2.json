Gradual changes suggest sources are spread out.\n3. **Quadrant Analysis**: Measure intensities in different quadrants (positive/negative x and y directions) to identify regions with higher intensities.\n4. **Proximity to High Intensity Points**: Points near high-intensity measurements will likely have higher intensities. For example, if [-0.5, 0] has a high intensity, nearby points like [-0.5, 0.5] or [-0.5, -0.5] will also have high intensities.\n5. **Diagonal Checks**: Measure diagonally to see if intensity changes similarly in all directions, indicating a central source.\n\nBy using these heuristics, you can make educated guesses about signal intensity based on observed patterns and gradients, even without knowing the exact source locations."
