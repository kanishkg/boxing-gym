The signal strength at any point is influenced by the distance to each of the three sources.\n2. Each source emits a signal of identical strength.\n3.

            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset and the description, we need to model the signal strength at any point in the grid as a superposition of signals from three unknown sources. Each source emits a signal of identical strength. The signal strength at any point is likely influenced by the distance from these sources.\n\n**Hypotheses:**\n1. The signal strength at any point is a function of the distances to the three sources.\n2. Each source emits a signal of identical strength.\n3. The signal strength decreases with distance from the source.\n\n**Plan:**\n1. Define the locations of the three sources as latent variables.\n2. Calculate the distance from each observation point to each source.\n3. Model the signal strength as a function of these distances.\n4. Use a normal distribution to model the observed signal strength with some noise.\n\n### Probabilistic Program\n\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x1 = observed_data['x1'].values\n    x2 = observed_data['x2'].values\n    signal_strength = observed_data['signal_strength'].values\n\n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create pm.MutableData objects for each non-observation column\n        x1_data = pm.MutableData(\"x1\", x1, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        x2_data = pm.MutableData(\"x2\", x2, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Define the locations of the three sources as latent variables\n        source_x = pm.Uniform(\"source_x\", lower=0, upper=10, shape=3)\n        source_y = pm.Uniform(\"source_y\", lower=0, upper=10, shape=3)\n        \n        # Calculate the distances from each observation point to each source\n        distances = pm.math.sqrt((x1_data[:, None] - source_x[None, :])**2 + \n                                 (x2_data[:, None] - source_y[None, :])**2)\n        \n        # Model the signal strength as a function of these distances\n        signal_strength_mean = pm.math.sum(1 / (distances + 1e-6), axis=1)\n        \n        # Define the likelihood of the observations\n        y_obs = pm.Normal(\"y_obs\", mu=signal_strength_mean, sigma=1, observed=signal_strength, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sample from the posterior\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=np.random.default_rng(42), idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=np.random.default_rng(314), return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n1. **Data Preparation:**\n   - Convert the observed data columns to numpy arrays for easier manipulation.\n   - Create `pm.MutableData` objects for `x1` and `x2` to allow for future updates to the data.\n\n2. **Model Definition:**\n   - Define the locations of the three sources (`source_x` and `source_y`) as uniform distributions between 0 and 10.\n   - Calculate the Euclidean distances from each observation point to each source.\n   - Model the signal strength as the sum of the inverse of these distances (to simulate the decrease in signal strength with distance).\n   - Define the likelihood of the observed signal strength as a normal distribution centered around the calculated signal strength with some noise (`sigma=1`).\n\n3. **Sampling:**\n   - Sample from the posterior distribution using `pm.sample`.\n   - Generate posterior predictive samples using `pm.sample_posterior_predictive`.\n\nThis model should capture the essence of the problem, where the signal strength at any point is influenced by the distances to three unknown sources. The next step would be to fit this model to the data and compare the results to the actual data to identify any discrepancies."
