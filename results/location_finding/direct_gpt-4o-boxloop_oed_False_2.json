The variance of y might be constant across all (x1, x2) points.\n\nTo start, we can use a linear model with interaction terms to capture potential non-linearities. This is a simple yet flexible approach that can be refined in subsequent rounds.\n\n### Plan:\n1. Define a linear model with interaction terms for x1 and x2.\n2. Use a normal distribution for the observations with a constant variance.\n3. Convert the observed data columns to numpy arrays.\n4. Use `pm.MutableData` for the non-observation columns.\n5. Sample from the posterior and posterior predictive distributions.\n\n### Program:\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x1_data = observed_data['x1'].values\n    x2_data = observed_data['x2'].values\n    y_data = observed_data['y'].values\n\n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n\n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create pm.MutableData objects for each non-observation column\n        x1 = pm.MutableData(\"x1\", x1_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        x2 = pm.MutableData(\"x2\", x2_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n\n        # Define priors for the coefficients and intercept\n        intercept = pm.Normal(\"intercept\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta_x1 = pm.Normal(\"beta_x1\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta_x2 = pm.Normal(\"beta_x2\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta_x1x2 = pm.Normal(\"beta_x1x2\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        sigma = pm.HalfNormal(\"sigma\", sigma=1)\n\n        # Define the linear model with interaction term\n        mu = intercept + beta_x1 * x1 + beta_x2 * x2 + beta_x1x2 * x1 * x2\n\n        # Define the likelihood\n        y_obs = pm.Normal(\"y_obs\", mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=y_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n\n        # Sample from the posterior\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n\n        # Sample from the posterior predictive\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n\n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Priors**: We use normal priors for the intercept and coefficients, and a half-normal prior for the standard deviation (sigma).\n- **Linear Model**: The model includes interaction terms to capture potential non-linearities.\n- **Likelihood**: The observations are modeled using a normal distribution with mean `mu` and standard deviation `sigma`.\n- **Sampling**: We sample from the posterior and posterior predictive distributions to make inferences and predictions.\n\nThis initial model is simple yet flexible enough to capture potential linear and interaction effects. We can refine it based on the discrepancies observed in the subsequent rounds."
