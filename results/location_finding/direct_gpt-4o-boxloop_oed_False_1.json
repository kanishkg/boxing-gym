            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset, we need to model the relationship between the 2-dimensional vectors (x1, x2) and the associated floating-point number y. Since we don't have any prior information about the nature of this relationship, we can start with a simple linear regression model. This model assumes that y is a linear combination of x1 and x2 plus some noise.\n\n#### Hypotheses:\n1. The relationship between (x1, x2) and y is linear.\n2. The noise in the observations is normally distributed.\n\n### Plan:\n1. Define the priors for the intercept and coefficients of the linear model.\n2. Define the likelihood of the observations using a normal distribution.\n3. Use PyMC to sample from the posterior distribution.\n\n### Program:\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x1_data = observed_data['x1'].values\n    x2_data = observed_data['x2'].values\n    y_data = observed_data['y'].values\n\n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n\n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create pm.MutableData objects for each non-observation column\n        x1 = pm.MutableData(\"x1\", x1_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        x2 = pm.MutableData(\"x2\", x2_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n\n        # Priors for the intercept and coefficients\n        intercept = pm.Normal(\"intercept\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        coef_x1 = pm.Normal(\"coef_x1\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        coef_x2 = pm.Normal(\"coef_x2\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        \n        # Linear model\n        mu = intercept + coef_x1 * x1 + coef_x2 * x2\n        \n        # Likelihood of the observations\n        sigma = pm.HalfNormal(\"sigma\", sigma=1)\n        y_obs = pm.Normal(\"y_obs\", mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=y_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n\n        # Sampling\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Priors**: We assume normal priors for the intercept and coefficients with mean 0 and standard deviation 10. This is a common choice when we don't have strong prior information.\n2. **Likelihood**: We assume that the observations y are normally distributed around the linear combination of x1 and x2, with a standard deviation sigma. We use a HalfNormal prior for sigma to ensure it is positive.\n3. **Sampling**: We use PyMC's `sample` function to draw samples from the posterior distribution and `sample_posterior_predictive` to generate posterior predictive samples.\n\nThis initial model is simple and assumes a linear relationship between the predictors and the response. We can refine it in subsequent rounds based on the discrepancies between the actual data and the sampled data.",
            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset, we need to model the relationship between the 2-dimensional vectors (x1, x2) and the associated floating-point number y. A reasonable starting point is to assume a linear relationship between x1, x2, and y, with some Gaussian noise. This is a classic approach for such datasets and should provide a good initial fit.\n\n#### Hypotheses:\n1. The relationship between x1, x2, and y can be modeled linearly.\n2. The noise in the observations follows a Gaussian distribution.\n\n### Plan:\n1. Define a linear model for y as a function of x1 and x2.\n2. Assume Gaussian noise for the observations.\n3. Use PyMC to define the probabilistic model and sample from the posterior.\n\n### Probabilistic Program\n\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x1_data = observed_data['x1'].values\n    x2_data = observed_data['x2'].values\n    y_data = observed_data['y'].values\n\n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n\n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create pm.MutableData objects for each non-observation column\n        x1 = pm.MutableData(\"x1\", x1_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        x2 = pm.MutableData(\"x2\", x2_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n\n        # Define priors for the linear model parameters\n        intercept = pm.Normal(\"intercept\", mu=0, sigma=1)\n        slope_x1 = pm.Normal(\"slope_x1\", mu=0, sigma=1)\n        slope_x2 = pm.Normal(\"slope_x2\", mu=0, sigma=1)\n        sigma = pm.HalfNormal(\"sigma\", sigma=1)\n\n        # Define the linear model\n        mu = intercept + slope_x1 * x1 + slope_x2 * x2\n\n        # Define the likelihood of the observations\n        y_obs = pm.Normal(\"y_obs\", mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=y_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n\n        # Sample from the posterior\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n\n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Data Conversion**: The observed data columns are converted to numpy arrays for easier manipulation.\n2. **Model Definition**: \n   - `pm.MutableData` is used to create mutable data objects for `x1` and `x2`.\n   - Priors are defined for the intercept and slopes of the linear model, as well as for the noise term (`sigma`).\n   - The linear model is defined as `mu = intercept + slope_x1 * x1 + slope_x2 * x2`.\n   - The likelihood of the observations is defined using a normal distribution with mean `mu` and standard deviation `sigma`.\n3. **Sampling**: The model samples from the posterior distribution and generates posterior predictive samples.\n\nThis initial model assumes a simple linear relationship with Gaussian noise. Based on the results, we can refine the model in subsequent rounds."
