The values seem to vary significantly even with small changes in coordinates. Since the point [-0.12289023, -0.93576943] is outside the range of the previously observed points, I will need to extrapolate based on the trend observed. The values near the origin are relatively lower compared to those further away, but the exact behavior outside the observed range is uncertain.

        "role:assistant, messaage:<thought>Given the observed values at various coordinates, it appears that the function is non-linear and influenced by both x and y coordinates. The values seem to decrease as we move away from the origin along the main diagonal, but this trend is not consistent in other directions. The point [-0.69166075, -0.39675353] is outside the range of the previously observed points, and based on the non-linear nature of the function, I will assume that the value will be higher than the values near the origin but lower than the values at the edges of the observed range.

The point [-0.67124613, -0.0126646] is outside the range of the previously observed points, so I will need to extrapolate based on the trend observed. The values seem to decrease as we move away from the origin along the y-axis and increase along the x-axis.
