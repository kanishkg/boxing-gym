            "To predict whether a person will choose a delayed reward over an immediate reward, consider three key factors: the value of the immediate reward (iR), the value of the delayed reward (dR), and the number of days delayed (D). \n\nFrom the observed data and inferred parameters, we can understand the decision-making process. The parameters suggest that the person is more likely to choose the delayed reward if the difference between dR and iR is significant and the delay (D) is not too long. Specifically, the parameter beta_dr (1.101) indicates a strong preference for higher delayed rewards, while beta_days (-1.193) shows a significant aversion to longer delays. The immediate reward (beta_ir = 0.042) has a smaller impact on the decision.\n\nFor example, if the immediate reward is $9 and the delayed reward is $10, the person is likely to choose the delayed reward if the delay is 9 days or less. However, if the delay extends to 10 days or more, the person tends to prefer the immediate reward. This pattern suggests a threshold around 9 days for this specific reward difference.\n\nIn summary, the person's choice is influenced by the relative values of the rewards and the delay duration. Larger differences between dR and iR and shorter delays increase the likelihood of choosing the delayed reward."
