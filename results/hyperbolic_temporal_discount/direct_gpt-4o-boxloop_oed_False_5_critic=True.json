A common approach for modeling binary outcomes is to use a logistic regression model.

            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the binary response variable `y` and the three positive integer predictors `x1`, `x2`, and `x3`, a logistic regression model is a reasonable starting point. Logistic regression is a classic model for binary outcomes and can capture the relationship between the predictors and the response.\n\n#### Hypotheses:\n1. The response variable `y` is influenced by the predictors `x1`, `x2`, and `x3`.\n2. The relationship between the predictors and the response is linear in the log-odds.\n\n### Plan:\n1. Use a logistic regression model where the log-odds of `y` being 1 is a linear combination of `x1`, `x2`, and `x3`.\n2. Define priors for the coefficients and the intercept.\n3. Use the observed data to fit the model and draw samples from the posterior.\n\n### Program:\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x1_data = observed_data['x1'].to_numpy()\n    x2_data = observed_data['x2'].to_numpy()\n    x3_data = observed_data['x3'].to_numpy()\n    y_data = observed_data['y'].to_numpy()\n    \n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n    \n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create pm.MutableData objects for each non-observation column\n        x1 = pm.MutableData(\"x1\", x1_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        x2 = pm.MutableData(\"x2\", x2_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        x3 = pm.MutableData(\"x3\", x3_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Define priors for the coefficients and intercept\n        intercept = pm.Normal(\"intercept\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta_x1 = pm.Normal(\"beta_x1\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta_x2 = pm.Normal(\"beta_x2\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta_x3 = pm.Normal(\"beta_x3\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        \n        # Define the linear combination of predictors\n        logit_p = intercept + beta_x1 * x1 + beta_x2 * x2 + beta_x3 * x3\n        \n        # Define the likelihood\n        p = pm.Deterministic(\"p\", pm.math.sigmoid(logit_p))\n        y_obs = pm.Bernoulli(\"y_obs\", p=p, observed=y_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sample from the posterior\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Priors**: Normal priors with mean 0 and standard deviation 10 are chosen for the intercept and coefficients.
