Logistic regression is commonly used for binary outcomes and can handle multiple predictors.\n\n1. **Modeling Approach**:\n   - Use a logistic regression model where the probability of \\( y = 1 \\) is modeled as a function of \\( x1 \\), \\( x2 \\), and \\( x3 \\).\n   - The logistic function will map the linear combination of \\( x1 \\), \\( x2 \\), and \\( x3 \\) to a probability between 0 and 1.\n\n2. **Priors**:\n   - Use normal priors for the coefficients of \\( x1 \\), \\( x2 \\), and \\( x3 \\).\n   - Use a normal prior for the intercept.\n\n3. **Likelihood**:\n   - The likelihood of \\( y \\) will be modeled using a Bernoulli distribution with the probability parameter given by the logistic function.\n\n### Probabilistic Program\n\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x1_data = observed_data['x1'].values\n    x2_data = observed_data['x2'].values\n    x3_data = observed_data['x3'].values\n    y_data = observed_data['y'].values\n\n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n\n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create pm.MutableData objects for each non-observation column\n        x1 = pm.MutableData(\"x1\", x1_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        x2 = pm.MutableData(\"x2\", x2_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        x3 = pm.MutableData(\"x3\", x3_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n\n        # Priors for the coefficients and intercept\n        intercept = pm.Normal(\"intercept\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta_x1 = pm.Normal(\"beta_x1\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta_x2 = pm.Normal(\"beta_x2\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta_x3 = pm.Normal(\"beta_x3\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n\n        # Linear combination of predictors\n        linear_combination = intercept + beta_x1 * x1 + beta_x2 * x2 + beta_x3 * x3\n\n        # Logistic function to map linear combination to probability\n        p = pm.Deterministic(\"p\", pm.math.sigmoid(linear_combination))\n\n        # Likelihood of the observations\n        y_obs = pm.Bernoulli(\"y_obs\", p=p, observed=y_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n\n        # Sampling\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n\n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **Data Conversion**: The observed data columns are converted to numpy arrays for easier manipulation.\n- **Model Definition**: A PyMC model is defined using the `with pm.Model() as model:` context.\n- **MutableData Objects**: The predictors \\( x1 \\), \\( x2 \\), and \\( x3 \\) are wrapped in `pm.MutableData` containers.\n- **Priors**: Normal priors are set for the intercept and the coefficients of the predictors.\n- **Linear Combination**: The linear combination of the predictors is calculated.\n- **Logistic Function**: The logistic function maps the linear combination to a probability.\n- **Likelihood**: The likelihood of the observations is modeled using a Bernoulli distribution.\n- **Sampling**: The model is sampled using `pm.sample` with specified parameters for reproducibility and efficiency.
