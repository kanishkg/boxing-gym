The probability of choosing the delayed reward can be influenced by the immediate reward (`ir`), the delayed reward (`dr`), and the number of days (`days`) one has to wait for the delayed reward.\n2. **Logistic Regression**: We will use a logistic function to model the probability of choosing the delayed reward. The logistic function will take a linear combination of the input features (`ir`, `dr`, `days`) as its argument.\n3. **Parameters**: We will introduce parameters for the coefficients of the logistic regression model.\n4. **Likelihood**: The observed choices will be modeled using a Bernoulli distribution with the probability parameter given by the logistic function.\n\n### Probabilistic Program\n\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    ir = observed_data['ir'].values\n    dr = observed_data['dr'].values\n    days = observed_data['days'].values\n\n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n    \n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create pm.MutableData objects for each non-observation column\n        ir_data = pm.MutableData(\"ir\", ir, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        dr_data = pm.MutableData(\"dr\", dr, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        days_data = pm.MutableData(\"days\", days, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Define priors for the coefficients\n        beta_ir = pm.Normal(\"beta_ir\", mu=0, sigma=1)\n        beta_dr = pm.Normal(\"beta_dr\", mu=0, sigma=1)\n        beta_days = pm.Normal(\"beta_days\", mu=0, sigma=1)\n        intercept = pm.Normal(\"intercept\", mu=0, sigma=1)\n        \n        # Linear combination of inputs\n        linear_combination = intercept + beta_ir * ir_data + beta_dr * dr_data + beta_days * days_data\n        \n        # Logistic function to model the probability of choosing the delayed reward\n        p = pm.Deterministic(\"p\", pm.math.sigmoid(linear_combination))\n        \n        # Likelihood of the observations\n        y_obs = pm.Bernoulli(\"y_obs\", p=p, observed=None, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sample from the prior\n        prior_predictive = pm.sample_prior_predictive(samples=1000, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, prior_predictive\n\n# Example usage:\n# observed_data = pd.DataFrame({\n#     'ir': [10, 20, 30],\n#     'dr': [15, 25, 35],\n#     'days': [5, 10, 15]\n# })\n# model, prior_predictive = gen_model(observed_data)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n1. **Data Conversion**: The columns `ir`, `dr`, and `days` from `observed_data` are converted to numpy arrays.\n2. **MutableData Objects**: `pm.MutableData` objects are created for each of the input columns (`ir`, `dr`, `days`) with `dims=\"obs_id\"`.\n3. **Priors for Coefficients**: Normal priors are defined for the coefficients (`beta_ir`, `beta_dr`, `beta_days`) and the intercept.\n4. **Linear Combination**: A linear combination of the input features is computed.\n5. **Logistic Function**: The logistic function is applied to the linear combination to get the probability `p` of choosing the delayed reward.\n6. **Likelihood**: The likelihood of the observations is modeled using a Bernoulli distribution with the probability `p`.\n7. **Prior Predictive Sampling**: Samples are drawn from the prior distribution to check the prior predictive distribution.\n\nThis model captures the relationship between the input features and the choice between a delayed and an immediate reward using a logistic regression framework.",
