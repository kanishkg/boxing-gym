For example, with iR = 9, dR = 10, and D = 3 or 7 days, the person chose the delayed reward.\n\n2. **Impact of Delay Duration**: As the delay increased, the person's preference shifted towards the immediate reward. For instance, with iR = 9, dR = 10, and D = 15 or 30 days, the person chose the immediate reward.\n\n3. **Threshold Identification**: The critical threshold for this person appears to be around 8-9 days. When D = 8 days, the person chose the delayed reward, but when D = 10 days, they chose the immediate reward. Testing with D = 9 days confirmed that the person still chose the delayed reward.\n\n**Conclusion**: The person values the delayed reward over the immediate reward if the delay is 8 days or less. For delays longer than 8 days, the immediate reward becomes more attractive. This suggests a strong preference for future rewards, but only up to a certain delay threshold."
