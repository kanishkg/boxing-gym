Since the delayed reward is always strictly larger than the immediate reward, we should start by varying the delay (D) while keeping the immediate and delayed rewards constant. This will help us understand the impact of delay on the decision.\n\nLet's start with a simple case where the immediate reward is 5 dollars, the delayed reward is 10 dollars, and the delay is 1 day. We will then gradually increase the delay to see how the person's choice changes.\n</thought>\n<observe>[5, 10, 1]</observe>",
