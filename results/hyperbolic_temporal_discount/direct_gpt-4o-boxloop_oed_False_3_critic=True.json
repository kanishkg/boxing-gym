            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the binary nature of the response variable \\( y \\) and the positive integer values of the predictors \\( x1 \\), \\( x2 \\), and \\( x3 \\), a logistic regression model is a reasonable starting point. Logistic regression is a classic model for binary outcomes and can handle multiple predictors.\n\n#### Hypotheses:\n1. The response variable \\( y \\) is influenced by the predictors \\( x1 \\), \\( x2 \\), and \\( x3 \\).\n2. The relationship between the predictors and the response is linear on the log-odds scale.\n\n#### Plan:\n1. Use a logistic regression model where the log-odds of \\( y \\) being 1 is a linear combination of \\( x1 \\), \\( x2 \\), and \\( x3 \\).\n2. Define priors for the coefficients and the intercept.\n3.
