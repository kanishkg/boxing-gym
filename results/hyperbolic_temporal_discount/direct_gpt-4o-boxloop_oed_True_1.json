Use PyMC to define the probabilistic model and sample from the posterior.\n\n### Probabilistic Program\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    ir = observed_data['ir'].values\n    dr = observed_data['dr'].values\n    days = observed_data['days'].values\n    choice = observed_data['Choice'].values\n\n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n\n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create pm.MutableData objects for each non-observation column\n        ir_data = pm.MutableData(\"ir\", ir, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        dr_data = pm.MutableData(\"dr\", dr, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        days_data = pm.MutableData(\"days\", days, dims=\"obs_id\")\n\n        # Define priors for the logistic regression coefficients\n        beta_ir = pm.Normal(\"beta_ir\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta_dr = pm.Normal(\"beta_dr\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta_days = pm.Normal(\"beta_days\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        intercept = pm.Normal(\"intercept\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n\n        # Define the logistic regression model\n        logit_p = intercept + beta_ir * ir_data + beta_dr * dr_data + beta_days * days_data\n        p = pm.Deterministic(\"p\", pm.math.sigmoid(logit_p))\n\n        # Define the likelihood\n        y_obs = pm.Bernoulli(\"y_obs\", p=p, observed=choice, dims=\"obs_id\")\n\n        # Sample from the posterior\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n\n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Data Conversion**: The observed data columns are converted to numpy arrays for easier manipulation.\n- **MutableData**: Each input feature (`ir`, `dr`, `days`) is wrapped in a `pm.MutableData` object to allow for easy updating and indexing.\n- **Priors**: Normal priors are defined for the logistic regression coefficients and the intercept.\n- **Logistic Regression**: The logistic function is used to model the probability of choosing the delayed reward.\n- **Likelihood**: The observed choices are modeled using a Bernoulli distribution with the probability `p`.\n- **Sampling**: The model samples from the posterior distribution and generates posterior predictive samples.\n\nThis initial model should provide a good starting point for understanding the relationship between the input variables and the choice. Further iterations can refine the model based on discrepancies between the actual data and the sampled data."

Let's start with a moderate immediate reward and a significantly higher delayed reward with a short delay.
