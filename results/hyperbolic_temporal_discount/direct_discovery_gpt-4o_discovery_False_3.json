When the third integer is 1, the response is consistently 1, regardless of the values of the first two integers. This was observed in [1, 2, 1], [1, 10, 1], and [2, 3, 1].\n2. When the third integer is greater than 1, the response is also 1 in most cases. This was observed in [2, 3, 2], [2, 10, 2], [2, 3, 3], and [2, 3, 6].\n3. The only exception observed was [1, 2, 5], which resulted in a response of 0. This suggests that there might be specific values or ranges of the third integer that result in a response of 0.\n\nGiven these observations, it seems that the response is generally 1 unless the third integer falls within a specific range that we have not fully identified yet. To predict the response, one might assume it to be 1 unless the third integer is known to be within a range that results in 0, such as the case with [1, 2, 5].\n\nFurther experiments with varying third integers, especially larger values, would help refine this understanding.</thought>"
