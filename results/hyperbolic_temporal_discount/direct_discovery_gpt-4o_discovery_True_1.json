Here are the key findings:\n\n1. **Immediate Reward (iR):** $5\n2. **Delayed Reward (dR):** $10\n3. **Threshold Delay (D):** Between 31 and 32 days\n\n### Observations:\n- For delays of 1, 5, 10, 20, and 30 days, the person consistently chose the delayed reward ($10).\n- For delays of 33, 35, and 40 days, the person switched to choosing the immediate reward ($5).\n- The critical threshold where the person switches from preferring the delayed reward to the immediate reward lies between 31 and 32 days.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe person is willing to wait up to 31 days for a delayed reward of $10 over an immediate reward of $5. However, if the delay extends to 32 days or more, they prefer the immediate reward. This suggests that the person's decision is influenced by the delay period, with a critical threshold around 31-32 days.\n\n### Prediction Strategy:\nTo predict the person's choice, compare the delay period (D) to the threshold:\n- If D \u2264 31 days, the person will likely choose the delayed reward.\n- If D > 31 days, the person will likely choose the immediate reward.\n\nThis understanding can help in predicting the person's choices in similar scenarios."
