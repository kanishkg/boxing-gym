The relationship between the input features and the binary response can be modeled using a logistic function.\n\n### Plan:\n1. Convert the observed data columns to numpy arrays.\n2. Create a `pm.Model` context.\n3. Define `pm.MutableData` objects for each input feature.\n4. Define priors for the logistic regression coefficients and intercept.\n5.
