            "To predict whether a person will choose a delayed reward over an immediate reward, consider three key factors: the immediate reward (iR), the delayed reward (dR), and the delay in days (D). The decision-making process can be influenced by how these factors interact.\n\n1. **Immediate Reward (iR)**: The higher the immediate reward, the more tempting it is for the person to choose it. However, if the immediate reward is significantly lower than the delayed reward, the person is more likely to wait.\n\n2. **Delayed Reward (dR)**: A larger delayed reward increases the likelihood that the person will choose to wait. The difference between the immediate and delayed rewards is crucial.\n\n3. **Delay (D)**: The number of days the person has to wait for the delayed reward also plays a role. A shorter delay makes the delayed reward more attractive, while a longer delay might make the immediate reward more appealing.\n\nBased on the inferred parameters from the statistical model, we can see that the immediate reward has a strong negative influence on choosing the delayed reward (beta_ir = -5.310), while the delayed reward has a strong positive influence (beta_dr = 4.198). The delay also has a positive influence but to a lesser extent (beta_days = 0.520). The intercept (0.175) and the probabilities (p) suggest that the person generally prefers the delayed reward unless the immediate reward is very close to the delayed reward.\n\nIn summary, to predict the choice:\n- If the immediate reward is much lower than the delayed reward, the person will likely choose the delayed reward.\n- If the immediate reward is close to the delayed reward, the person may choose the immediate reward, especially if the delay is long."
