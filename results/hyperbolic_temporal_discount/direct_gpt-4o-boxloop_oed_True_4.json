            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset, we need to model a person's choice between a delayed reward and an immediate reward. The choice is likely influenced by the immediate reward (`ir`), the delayed reward (`dr`), and the number of days (`days`) one has to wait for the delayed reward. \n\nA common approach to model such binary choices is to use logistic regression, where the probability of choosing the delayed reward can be modeled as a logistic function of the input variables (`ir`, `dr`, and `days`). \n\n### Plan\n1. **Model the Choice**: Use a logistic regression model where the probability of choosing the delayed reward is a function of `ir`, `dr`, and `days`.\n2. **Define Priors**: Set priors for the coefficients of the logistic regression.\n3. **Likelihood**: Define the likelihood of the observed choices using a Bernoulli distribution with the probability given by the logistic function.\n\n### Program\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    ir = observed_data['ir'].values\n    dr = observed_data['dr'].values\n    days = observed_data['days'].values\n    choice = observed_data['Choice'].values\n\n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n\n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create pm.MutableData objects for each non-observation column\n        ir_data = pm.MutableData(\"ir\", ir, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        dr_data = pm.MutableData(\"dr\", dr, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        days_data = pm.MutableData(\"days\", days, dims=\"obs_id\")\n\n        # Define priors for the coefficients\n        beta_ir = pm.Normal(\"beta_ir\", mu=0, sigma=1)\n        beta_dr = pm.Normal(\"beta_dr\", mu=0, sigma=1)\n        beta_days = pm.Normal(\"beta_days\", mu=0, sigma=1)\n        intercept = pm.Normal(\"intercept\", mu=0, sigma=1)\n\n        # Logistic regression model\n        logit_p = intercept + beta_ir * ir_data + beta_dr * dr_data + beta_days * days_data\n        p = pm.Deterministic(\"p\", pm.math.sigmoid(logit_p))\n\n        # Likelihood\n        y_obs = pm.Bernoulli(\"y_obs\", p=p, observed=choice, dims=\"obs_id\")\n\n        # Sampling\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n\n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Priors**: We use normal priors for the coefficients (`beta_ir`, `beta_dr`, `beta_days`) and the intercept. This is a common choice for logistic regression.\n- **Logistic Regression**: The probability of choosing the delayed reward is modeled using a logistic function of the input variables.\n- **Likelihood**: The observed choices are modeled using a Bernoulli distribution with the probability given by the logistic function.\n- **Sampling**: We sample from the posterior distribution using `pm.sample` and then generate posterior predictive samples using `pm.sample_posterior_predictive`.\n\nThis model should capture the relationship between the input variables and the choice, allowing us to make probabilistic predictions about future choices."
