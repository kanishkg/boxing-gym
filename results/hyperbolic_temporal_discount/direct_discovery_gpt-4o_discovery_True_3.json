The delayed reward (dR) was always larger than the immediate reward (iR). Here are the key observations:\n\n1. When the immediate reward was 1 dollar and the delayed reward was 10 dollars, the person chose the delayed reward even with delays of 7 days and 3 days.\n2. Increasing the immediate reward to 5 dollars with a 3-day delay still resulted in the person choosing the delayed reward.\n3. When the immediate reward was increased to 8 dollars with a 3-day delay, the person chose the immediate reward.\n4. Narrowing down, the person chose the delayed reward when the immediate reward was 7 dollars, 7.5 dollars, 7.8 dollars, and 7.9 dollars with a 3-day delay.\n5. Surprisingly, the person chose the delayed reward even when the immediate reward was 8 dollars with a 3-day delay.\n\nFrom these observations, it appears the person has a strong preference for the delayed reward unless the immediate reward is very close to the delayed reward. The threshold seems to be around 8 dollars for a 10-dollar delayed reward with a 3-day delay. This suggests the person values future rewards significantly and has a low discount rate."
