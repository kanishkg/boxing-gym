            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset, we need to model a person's choice between a delayed reward and an immediate reward. The choice is likely influenced by the immediate reward (`ir`), the delayed reward (`dr`), and the number of days (`days`) one has to wait for the delayed reward. \n\nA reasonable approach is to use a logistic regression model where the probability of choosing the delayed reward is modeled as a function of `ir`, `dr`, and `days`. This is because the choice is binary (0 or 1), making logistic regression a suitable model.\n\n### Plan\n1. **Data Preparation**: Convert the observed data columns to numpy arrays.\n2. **Model Specification**:\n   - Use a logistic regression model to predict the probability of choosing the delayed reward.\n   - Define priors for the regression coefficients.\n   - Use the logistic function to model the probability of choosing the delayed reward.\n3. **Sampling**: Use PyMC to sample from the posterior distribution and generate posterior predictive samples.\n\n### Program\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    ir = observed_data['ir'].values\n    dr = observed_data['dr'].values\n    days = observed_data['days'].values\n    choice = observed_data['Choice'].values\n\n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n\n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create pm.MutableData objects for each non-observation column\n        ir_data = pm.MutableData(\"ir\", ir, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        dr_data = pm.MutableData(\"dr\", dr, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        days_data = pm.MutableData(\"days\", days, dims=\"obs_id\")\n\n        # Define priors for the regression coefficients\n        beta_ir = pm.Normal(\"beta_ir\", mu=0, sigma=1)\n        beta_dr = pm.Normal(\"beta_dr\", mu=0, sigma=1)\n        beta_days = pm.Normal(\"beta_days\", mu=0, sigma=1)\n        intercept = pm.Normal(\"intercept\", mu=0, sigma=1)\n\n        # Logistic regression model\n        logit_p = intercept + beta_ir * ir_data + beta_dr * dr_data + beta_days * days_data\n        p = pm.Deterministic(\"p\", pm.math.sigmoid(logit_p))\n\n        # Likelihood\n        y_obs = pm.Bernoulli(\"y_obs\", p=p, observed=choice, dims=\"obs_id\")\n\n        # Sampling\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n\n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Data Preparation**: The observed data columns are converted to numpy arrays for easier manipulation.\n- **Model Specification**:\n  - `pm.MutableData` is used to create mutable data objects for `ir`, `dr`, and `days`.\n  - Priors for the regression coefficients (`beta_ir`, `beta_dr`, `beta_days`) and the intercept are defined as normal distributions with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.\n  - The logistic regression model is specified using the logistic function (`pm.math.sigmoid`).\n  - The likelihood of the observed choices is modeled using a Bernoulli distribution with the probability `p`.\n- **Sampling**: PyMC is used to sample from the posterior distribution and generate posterior predictive samples. The `idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True}` argument is passed to `pm.sample` to include log-likelihood in the inference data.\n\nThis model should provide a good starting point for understanding the factors influencing the choice between immediate and delayed rewards."
