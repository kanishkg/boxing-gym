            "To predict whether a person will choose an immediate reward (iR) or a delayed reward (dR) after D days, consider the following insights derived from a statistical model:\n\n1. **Immediate Reward (iR)**: The attractiveness of the immediate reward negatively impacts the likelihood of choosing the delayed reward. A higher iR makes the immediate option more appealing.\n\n2. **Delayed Reward (dR)**: The attractiveness of the delayed reward positively impacts the likelihood of choosing it. A higher dR makes waiting more worthwhile.\n\n3. **Delay (D)**: The length of the delay negatively impacts the likelihood of choosing the delayed reward. A longer delay makes the immediate reward more appealing.\n\n4. **Intercept**: This represents the baseline preference for the delayed reward when all other factors are zero.\n\nThe model uses these factors to calculate a probability (p) of choosing the delayed reward. If p is high (close to 1), the person is likely to choose the delayed reward. If p is low (close to 0), they are likely to choose the immediate reward.\n\nFor example, if iR is $7, dR is $10, and D is 23 days, the person is likely to choose the immediate reward. However, if D is reduced to 22 days, they might switch to preferring the delayed reward. This indicates a threshold around 22-23 days where their preference changes.\n\nUnderstanding these relationships helps predict choices based on the values of iR, dR, and D."
