            "To predict a person's choice between an immediate reward (iR) and a delayed reward (dR) after D days, consider the following conceptual framework based on observed behavior and inferred parameters.\n\n1. **Immediate vs. Delayed Reward**: People generally prefer larger rewards, but the delay (D) plays a crucial role. The larger the delay, the less attractive the delayed reward becomes.\n\n2. **Inferred Parameters**: The model suggests that the immediate reward (iR) has a negative impact on choosing the delayed reward (beta_ir = -0.481), meaning higher immediate rewards make the immediate option more attractive. Conversely, the delayed reward (dR) has a positive impact (beta_dr = 1.040), making higher delayed rewards more attractive. The delay (D) has a negative impact (beta_days = -0.274), meaning longer delays make the delayed reward less attractive.\n\n3. **Threshold Behavior**: From the experiments, we observed that the person switched from preferring the delayed reward to the immediate reward when the immediate reward was around 5.65 dollars with a 30-day delay. This indicates a threshold where the immediate reward becomes sufficiently attractive to outweigh the delayed reward.\n\n4. **Decision Probability**: The probability of choosing the delayed reward decreases as the immediate reward increases or the delay lengthens. For example, with an immediate reward of 5.75 dollars and a 30-day delay, the person chose the immediate reward, indicating a lower probability of choosing the delayed reward.\n\nIn summary, to predict choices, consider the relative sizes of iR and dR, and the length of D. Higher immediate rewards and longer delays make the immediate reward more attractive."
