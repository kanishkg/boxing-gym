            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset, we need to model a person's choice between a delayed reward and an immediate reward. The choice is likely influenced by the immediate reward (`ir`), the delayed reward (`dr`), and the number of days (`days`) one has to wait for the delayed reward. \n\nA common approach to model such binary choices is to use logistic regression, where the probability of choosing the delayed reward can be modeled as a logistic function of the input variables (`ir`, `dr`, and `days`). \n\n### Plan\n1. **Model the Choice**: Use a logistic regression model where the probability of choosing the delayed reward is a function of `ir`, `dr`, and `days`.\n2. **Define Priors**: Set priors for the coefficients of the logistic regression.\n3. **Likelihood**: Define the likelihood of the observed choices using a Bernoulli distribution with the probability parameter from the logistic regression.\n\n### Program\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    ir = observed_data['ir'].values\n    dr = observed_data['dr'].values\n    days = observed_data['days'].values\n    choice = observed_data['Choice'].values\n\n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n    \n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create pm.MutableData objects for each non-observation column\n        ir_data = pm.MutableData(\"ir\", ir, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        dr_data = pm.MutableData(\"dr\", dr, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        days_data = pm.MutableData(\"days\", days, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Define priors for the coefficients\n        beta_ir = pm.Normal(\"beta_ir\", mu=0, sigma=1)\n        beta_dr = pm.Normal(\"beta_dr\", mu=0, sigma=1)\n        beta_days = pm.Normal(\"beta_days\", mu=0, sigma=1)\n        intercept = pm.Normal(\"intercept\", mu=0, sigma=1)\n        \n        # Logistic regression model\n        logit_p = intercept + beta_ir * ir_data + beta_dr * dr_data + beta_days * days_data\n        p = pm.Deterministic(\"p\", pm.math.sigmoid(logit_p))\n        \n        # Likelihood\n        y_obs = pm.Bernoulli(\"y_obs\", p=p, observed=choice, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sampling\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Priors**: We use normal priors for the coefficients (`beta_ir`, `beta_dr`, `beta_days`) and the intercept. These priors are centered at 0 with a standard deviation of 1.\n- **Logistic Regression**: The probability of choosing the delayed reward is modeled using a logistic function of the input variables.\n- **Likelihood**: The observed choices are modeled using a Bernoulli distribution with the probability parameter from the logistic regression.\n- **Sampling**: We sample from the posterior distribution and the posterior predictive distribution to make inferences about the model parameters and the observed data.\n\nThis initial model should provide a good starting point for understanding the relationship between the input variables and the choice. We can refine the model based on the discrepancies between the actual data and the sampled data in subsequent rounds.",

This model will allow us to estimate the probability of choosing the delayed reward over the immediate reward.\n\n**Hypotheses:**\n1. The probability of choosing the delayed reward depends on the immediate reward, delayed reward, and the number of days.\n2. There might be interaction effects between `ir`, `dr`, and `days`.\n\n**Plan:**\n1. Use a logistic regression model with linear terms for `ir`, `dr`, and `days`.\n2.
