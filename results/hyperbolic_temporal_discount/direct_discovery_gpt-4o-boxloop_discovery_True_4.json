This means people are more likely to choose the immediate reward when it is higher.\n\n2. **Delayed Reward (dR)**: The positive coefficient for dR (0.872) indicates that as the delayed reward increases, the likelihood of choosing the delayed reward also increases. People are more inclined to wait for a larger reward.\n\n3. **Delay (D)**: The small negative coefficient for days (-0.026) suggests that longer delays slightly decrease the likelihood of choosing the delayed reward, but this effect is relatively weak compared to the reward amounts.\n\nThe intercept (0.051) and the probabilities (p values) indicate a baseline tendency to choose the delayed reward, which is adjusted by the specific values of iR, dR, and D.\n\nIn summary, people are more likely to choose the delayed reward if it is significantly larger than the immediate reward and the delay is not excessively long.
