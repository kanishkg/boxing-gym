The logistic growth model can be described by the following differential equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{dI}{dt} = rI \\left(1 - \\frac{I}{K}\\right) \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( I \\) is the number of infected individuals,\n- \\( r \\) is the growth rate,\n- \\( K \\) is the carrying capacity (maximum number of infected individuals, which in this case is the total population, 50).\n\nWe can discretize this model and use it to define our generative model in PyMC.\n\n### Plan\n\n1. Define the logistic growth model.\n2. Use PyMC to define the probabilistic model.\n3. Sample from the posterior and posterior predictive distributions.\n4.

These priors are chosen based on reasonable assumptions about the disease spread.\n- **Logistic Growth Model**: The mean number of infections is modeled using the logistic growth equation.\n- **Likelihood**: The observed number of infections is assumed to follow a normal distribution around the mean given by the logistic growth model, with some standard deviation \\( \\sigma \\).\n- **Sampling**: We sample from the posterior distribution to fit the model to the data and generate posterior predictive samples.\n\nThis model should capture the logistic growth pattern of the disease spread in the population."
