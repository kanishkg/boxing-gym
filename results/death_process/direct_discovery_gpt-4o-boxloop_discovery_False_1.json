            "Based on the experimental data and the inferred parameters, it appears that the relationship between the input (a float between 0 and 2) and the output (a positive integer) can be modeled using a Poisson distribution with a rate parameter that increases exponentially with the input.\n\nThe observed data suggests that the output increases as the input increases, but not in a simple linear fashion. Instead, the rate of increase accelerates as the input grows. For example, the output for an input of 0.1 is 5, while for 0.2 it drops to 0, and then for 0.3 it jumps to 10. This non-linear pattern continues, with the output generally increasing more rapidly as the input gets larger.\n\nThe inferred parameters from the model indicate that the rate parameter (lambda) for the Poisson distribution grows exponentially with the input. Specifically, the rate parameter is determined by an exponential function of the input, with coefficients that have been inferred from the data.\n\nTo predict the output for a given input, you can expect that small increases in the input will lead to larger increases in the output, especially as the input approaches the upper limit of 2. The relationship is not straightforward, so predictions should account for the possibility of rapid changes in the output as the input increases."
