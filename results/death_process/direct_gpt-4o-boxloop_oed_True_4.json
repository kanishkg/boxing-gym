            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset and the nature of the problem, we need to model the number of infected individuals over time. The number of infections is likely to follow a logistic growth model, which is common in epidemiology for modeling the spread of diseases. The logistic growth model can be described by the following equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{infection\\_num}(x) = \\frac{K}{1 + \\exp(-r(x - x_0))} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( K \\) is the carrying capacity (maximum number of infections),\n- \\( r \\) is the growth rate,\n- \\( x_0 \\) is the inflection point (the time at which the growth rate is highest).\n\nWe will use this logistic growth model to define our generative model in PyMC.\n\n### Probabilistic Program\n\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x = observed_data['x'].values\n    infection_num = observed_data['infection_num'].values\n    \n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n    \n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create a pm.MutableData object for each non-observation column\n        x_data = pm.MutableData(\"x\", x, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Define priors for the logistic growth parameters\n        K = pm.Normal(\"K\", mu=50, sigma=10)  # Carrying capacity\n        r = pm.Normal(\"r\", mu=1, sigma=0.5)  # Growth rate\n        x_0 = pm.Normal(\"x_0\", mu=1, sigma=0.5)  # Inflection point\n        \n        # Define the logistic growth model\n        mu = K / (1 + pm.math.exp(-r * (x_data - x_0)))\n        \n        # Define the likelihood of the observations\n        y_obs = pm.Normal(\"y_obs\", mu=mu, sigma=5, observed=infection_num, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sample from the posterior\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        \n        # Sample from the posterior predictive\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n1. **Data Preparation**:\n   - Convert the columns `x` and `infection_num` from the observed data to numpy arrays.\n\n2. **Model Definition**:\n   - Create a `pm.Model` context.\n   - Define `x` as a `pm.MutableData` object to allow for future updates.\n   - Define priors for the logistic growth parameters \\( K \\), \\( r \\), and \\( x_0 \\).\n   - Define the logistic growth model using the priors.\n   - Define the likelihood of the observations using a normal distribution with mean `mu` and a standard deviation of 5.\n\n3. **Sampling**:\n   - Sample from the posterior distribution using `pm.sample`.\n   - Sample from the posterior predictive distribution using `pm.sample_posterior_predictive`.\n\n4. **Return**:\n   - Return the model, posterior predictive samples, and trace.\n\nThis initial model uses a logistic growth function to model the number of infections over time. The priors for the parameters are chosen based on typical values for such models. The standard deviation for the likelihood is set to 5, which can be adjusted based on the observed data."
