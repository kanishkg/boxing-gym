For example, the output at 1.0 is lower than at 0.75 and 1.1. The highest observed output is 50 at 1.75, indicating a possible upper limit. \n\nTo predict the output for a new input, consider the general trend of increasing values with some variability. For inputs closer to 0, expect lower outputs, and for inputs closer to 2, expect higher outputs, potentially near 50. However, be aware of possible fluctuations around the trend."
