            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the nature of the data, we are dealing with a disease spreading in a population over time. A common model for such scenarios is the logistic growth model, which captures the initial exponential growth and eventual saturation as the disease spreads through the population.\n\n#### Hypotheses:\n1. The number of infected individuals follows a logistic growth curve over time.\n2. The observations (infection_num) are normally distributed around the logistic growth curve with some noise.\n\n#### Plan:\n1. Define the logistic growth function.\n2. Use PyMC to model the parameters of the logistic growth curve.\n3. Define the likelihood of the observed data given the logistic growth model.\n4.
