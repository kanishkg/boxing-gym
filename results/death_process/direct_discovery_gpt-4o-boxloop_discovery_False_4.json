            "Based on the experimental data and the inferred parameters from a statistical model, we can understand the relationship between the input (a float between 0 and 2) and the output (a positive integer between 1 and 50).\n\nThe model suggests that the output is determined by an exponential function of the input. Specifically, the output increases exponentially as the input increases. The model uses two parameters, beta_0 and beta_1, which are approximately 2.630 and 0.931, respectively. These parameters influence the rate at which the output increases.\n\nFor small inputs close to 0, the output starts low. As the input increases, the output grows rapidly due to the exponential nature of the relationship. For example, small changes in input around 0.1 to 0.3 can result in significant changes in output. This is evident from the observed data where an input of 0.01 resulted in an output of 1, while an input of 0.11 resulted in an output of 15.\n\nAs the input approaches the upper limit of the range (close to 2), the output tends to plateau, reaching values close to the maximum observed output of 50. This plateau effect is due to the nature of the exponential function, where the rate of increase slows down as the input becomes larger.\n\nIn summary, the output increases exponentially with the input, with rapid changes at lower input values and a plateau effect at higher input values."
