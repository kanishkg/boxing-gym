However, after time 1.0, the rate of infection slows down, with smaller increases and even slight decreases in the number of infected individuals. This suggests that the infection may be approaching a saturation point where fewer individuals are susceptible to infection.\n\nTo predict the number of infected individuals at a specific time, consider that the infection rate decreases over time.
