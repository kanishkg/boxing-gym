The observations \\( y \\) are positive integers with a maximum value of 50, and the input values \\( x1 \\) are positive real numbers.\n\n#### Hypotheses:\n1. The relationship between \\( x1 \\) and \\( y \\) might be linear or non-linear.\n2. Since \\( y \\) is a positive integer, a Poisson distribution could be a good candidate for modeling \\( y \\).\n3. The rate parameter (\\(\\lambda\\)) of the Poisson distribution could be a function of \\( x1 \\).\n\n#### Plan:\n1. Use a Poisson distribution to model \\( y \\).\n2. Model the rate parameter (\\(\\lambda\\)) of the Poisson distribution as a function of \\( x1 \\). A common approach is to use a log-linear model: \\(\\log(\\lambda) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x1\\).\n3. Use priors for the parameters \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\).\n\n### Probabilistic Program\n\n```python\nimport pymc as pm\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef gen_model(observed_data):\n    # Convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays\n    x1_data = observed_data['x1'].values\n    y_data = observed_data['y'].values\n\n    rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)\n    \n    with pm.Model() as model:\n        # Create a pm.MutableData object for each non-observation column\n        x1 = pm.MutableData(\"x1\", x1_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Priors for the parameters\n        beta_0 = pm.Normal(\"beta_0\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        beta_1 = pm.Normal(\"beta_1\", mu=0, sigma=10)\n        \n        # Linear model for the rate parameter of the Poisson distribution\n        lambda_ = pm.math.exp(beta_0 + beta_1 * x1)\n        \n        # Likelihood\n        y_obs = pm.Poisson(\"y_obs\", mu=lambda_, observed=y_data, dims=\"obs_id\")\n        \n        # Sampling\n        trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1, idata_kwargs={\"log_likelihood\": True})\n        posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)\n        \n        return model, posterior_predictive, trace\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Data Conversion**: The observed data columns are converted to numpy arrays.\n2. **Model Definition**: \n   - `x1` is defined as a `pm.MutableData` object.\n   - Priors for the parameters \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) are set as normal distributions with mean 0 and standard deviation 10.\n   - The rate parameter \\(\\lambda\\) of the Poisson distribution is modeled as \\(\\exp(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x1)\\).\n   - The likelihood of the observations \\( y \\) is modeled using a Poisson distribution with the rate parameter \\(\\lambda\\).\n3. **Sampling**: The model is sampled using `pm.sample` with specified parameters for reproducibility and efficiency. The posterior predictive samples are also generated.\n\nThis initial model assumes a log-linear relationship between \\( x1 \\) and the rate parameter of the Poisson distribution for \\( y \\). This is a reasonable starting point given the nature of the data.",
