            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset and the nature of the problem, it seems like the number of infected individuals over time could follow a logistic growth model. This is a common model for the spread of diseases in a population, where the growth rate slows as the number of infected individuals approaches the total population size.\n\n**Hypotheses:**\n1. The number of infected individuals follows a logistic growth curve over time.\n2. The observations (infection_num) are normally distributed around the logistic growth curve with some noise.\n\n**Plan:**\n1. Define the logistic growth function.\n2. Use PyMC to define priors for the parameters of the logistic growth function.\n3. Define the likelihood of the observed data given the logistic growth function.\n4.
