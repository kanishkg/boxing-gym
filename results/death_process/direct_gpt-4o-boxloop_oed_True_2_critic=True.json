            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset, we need to model the number of infected individuals over time. The data suggests a logistic growth pattern, which is common in epidemiological models where the infection rate starts slow, accelerates, and then slows down as it approaches the carrying capacity of the population.\n\n#### Hypotheses:\n1. The number of infections follows a logistic growth curve over time.\n2. The carrying capacity (maximum number of infections) is the total population, which is 50.\n3. There is some observation noise in the number of infections.\n\n### Plan:\n1. Use a logistic growth model to describe the number of infections over time.\n2. Define the carrying capacity as 50.\n3. Introduce parameters for the growth rate and the midpoint of the logistic curve.\n4.
