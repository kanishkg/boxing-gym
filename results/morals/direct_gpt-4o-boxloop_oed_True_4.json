Define normal priors for the logistic regression coefficients and the intercept.\n\n4. **Logistic Regression**:\n   - Define the logistic regression model using the feature differences and the intervention type.\n   - Compute the probability `p` using the logistic function.\n\n5. **Likelihood**:\n   - Define the likelihood of the observed choices using a Bernoulli distribution with the computed probability `p`.\n   - Ensure `observed=None` to indicate that we are not using actual observations for this step.\n\n6. **Sampling from the Prior**:\n   - Sample from the prior predictive distribution to generate prior samples.\n\n### Important Notes\n- Ensure that the column names are correctly indexed from `observed_data`.\n- Use `pm.MutableData` for each feature column and pass `dims=\"obs_id\"`.\n- Do not use `pm.Constant()` for parameters.\n- Ensure `observed=None` for the likelihood to avoid financial consequences.",

The differences in group characteristics (count, gender, age, social status, fitness, species) influence the participant's choice.\n2. The type of intervention (swerve or stay) also influences the participant's choice.\n\n### Plan\n1. Convert the observed data columns to numpy arrays.\n2. Create a PyMC model.\n3.
