The input features are `group1_group2_count_diff`, `group1_group2_gender_diff`, `group1_group2_age_diff`, `group1_group2_social_status_diff`, `group1_group2_fitness_diff`, `group1_group2_species_diff`, and `intervention`.\n   - These features will be used to predict the probability `p` of choosing group 2.\n\n3. **Logistic Regression**:\n   - We will use a logistic regression model to link the input features to the probability `p`.\n   -

            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\nGiven the dataset and the nature of the problem, we can model the participant's choice as a binary outcome influenced by the differences in group characteristics and the intervention type. A logistic regression model is a suitable choice for this type of binary outcome.\n\n**Hypotheses:**\n1. The differences in group characteristics (count, gender, age, social status, fitness, species) influence the participant's choice.\n2. The type of intervention (swerve or stay) also influences the participant's choice.\n\n### Plan:\n1. Convert the observed data columns to numpy arrays.\n2. Create a `pm.MutableData` object for each non-observation column.\n3. Define a logistic regression model where the probability of choosing group 1 or group 2 is modeled as a function of the differences in group characteristics and the intervention type.\n4.
