            "### High-Level Probabilistic Program Sketch\n\n1. **Modeling the Choice**:\n   - The choice of which group to save (group 1 or group 2) can be modeled as a binary outcome.\n   - We will use a logistic regression model to predict the probability of choosing group 2 based on the input features.\n\n2. **Input Features**:\n   - The input features include differences between the two groups in terms of count, gender, age, social status, fitness, and species, as well as the intervention required (swerve or stay).\n   - These features will be used as predictors in the logistic regression model.\n\n3. **Logistic Regression**:\n   - The logistic regression model will have coefficients for each of the input features.\n   - The probability of choosing group 2 will be modeled using the logistic function applied to a linear combination of the input features.\n\n4. **Prior Distributions**:\n   -
