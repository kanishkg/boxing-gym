Here is a description of the columns \n
{column_description}
If you are in the first round, you will not receive any additional information.
However, for the second round and beyond, I will give you the model you proposed previously.

Please import pymc NOT pymc3!
Note that there are differences in the arguments pymc expects. 
IMPORTANT: do not use sd as an argument use sigma instead!
It is crucial that you pass the idata_kwargs argument to pm.sample!!
IMPORTANT: Use the variable name "y_obs" for the observations when you define it!
IMPORTANT: Use the variable name "y_obs" for the observations when you define it!
IMPORTANT: Index the appropriate column names when grabbing data from observed_data. These column names are indicated in the column description.
IMPORTANT: If appropriate, you may want to apply transfomations to the columns.

Your answer should follow the template in the following order.
1. First, sketch a high-level probabilistic program for the data.
  You will go through multiple rounds of revision. 
  If there's a previous program in your context window and a list of hypotheses, revise based on this information!
  Explicitly cite the hypotheses (if there are any) that you address in your sketch.
2. After coming up with a plan, write your program and add comments to lines of code that address certain hypotheses.
```python
  import pymc as pm
  import numpy as np
  def gen_model(observed_data):
      # convert observed_data columns to numpy arrays
      # index the appropriate column names
      
      ....
      rng1 = np.random.default_rng(42)
      rng2 = np.random.default_rng(314)
      with pm.Model as model():
          # create a pm.MutableData object for each non-observation column 
          ...Your code here...
          # Copy the rest of this code verbatim but remember to have this indented in scope of model()!
          trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, target_accept=0.90, chains=3, cores=1, random_seed=rng1)
          posterior_predictive = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace, random_seed=rng2, return_inferencedata=False)
          return model, posterior_predictive, trace
```
Do not forget to pass idata_kwargs={{"log_likelihood": True}}) to pm.sample!
IMPORTANT: do not use sd as an argument use sigma instead! sd will not be recognized as a keyword argument.
The input to data gen_model, observed_data, contains the columns described earlier.
Please convert the observed data columns to numpy arrays before using them.
IMPORTANT: set seed for reproducibility! Only use the random seeds in the trace and posterior_predictive line!!
IMPORTANT: Don't use Gaussian processes; the log prob is broken.
IMPORTANT: Please explicitly index column names into the dataframe! Never grab the raw index like this: data = observed_data.index 
IMPORTANT: If you're going to use pandas, make sure you import it!
IMPORTANT: Make sure you are using the correct column names when grabbing data from observed_data. These column names are indicated in the column description.
IMPORTANT: Pass in cores=1 to pm.sample but NOT for pm.sample_posterior_predictive.
IMPORTANT: Do not forget to actually write the program! You will cost me millions if you don't return the program. 
I do not have fingers so I can't code the program  on my own.
IMPORTANT: Make sure you actually write the program! Donâ€™t just sketch it!
IMPORTANT: In gen model, stick to this return order model, posterior_predictive, trace
IMPORTANT: 
FOr every feature, you should wrap it in a MutableData container.
For example, if your columns are 'x1', 'x2, and 'y' and 'y' is your observation, then you need to do this:
with pm.model() as model:
    x1 = pm.MutableData("x1", observed_data['x1'], dims='obs_id')
    x2 = pm.MutableData("x2", observed_data['x2'], dims='obs_id')
If you forget this you will cost me millions of dollars!

Please give the features the exact same name as the columns in the dataset! Do not change them or else you will cost me a billion dollars.
Importantly, also pass dims="obs_id". For example if the input feature is in a column named "x" create a mutable data object named x as follows:

Please also pass dims="obs_id" to the definition of the likelihood of the observations as well. 
For example, if the likelihood is a normal distribution and your observations are in column 'y', you should pass dims="obs_id" like this:
    y_obs = pm.Normal("y_obs", mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=observed_data['y'], dims="obs_id")
IMPORTANT: Do not use pm.Constant() for parameters. 
Do not pass in dims for latent variables or parameters.
IMPORTANT: If there are multiple likelihoods, pass all the names of the observations as a list to the var_names argument for pm.sample.
IMPORTANT: If there are multiple likelihoods, pass all the names of the observations as a list to the var_names argument for pm.sample.
